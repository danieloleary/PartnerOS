## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
Deliver a compelling, repeatable pitch that articulates why partners should invest in your ecosystem—especially for enterprise, mission-critical solutions with complex sales cycles.

**Steps:**

2. Customize slides 2-4 based on discovery call insights
3. Prepare speaker notes and anticipate objections
4. Add partner-specific data and relevant case studies
5. Practice the 30-minute and 60-minute versions

**Pro Tips:**
- Lead with *their* business problems, not your product features
- For enterprise partners, emphasize deal size, sales cycle support, and margin
- Always end with clear, time-bound next steps

## Slide-by-Slide Guide

### Slide 1: Title & Logistics

**Content:**
```
[Your Company] + [Partner Company]
Strategic Partnership Overview

[Date]
[Presenter Name, Title]
[Presenter Name, Title]
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Thank them for their time—acknowledge busy schedules
- Confirm meeting duration and agenda
- Ask: "Before we dive in, what's most important for you to get out of today's conversation?"
- Capture their priorities to tailor your emphasis

**Do:**
- Include both company logos (shows partnership mindset)
- Have a backup presenter if key stakeholder drops

**Don't:**
- Start with your company history—they can Google that
- Rush through logistics—setting expectations prevents overruns

---

### Slide 2: Agenda

**Content:**
```
Today's Conversation

1. Why we're excited about [Partner] (5 min)
2. Market opportunity we see together (10 min)
3. How we enable partner success (10 min)
4. Economics and program structure (10 min)
5. Next steps and timeline (5 min)
6. Your questions (10 min)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Customize timing based on their stated priorities
- If they said "economics" matter most, offer to jump there first
- Build in buffer—enterprise conversations always run long

---

### Slide 3: Why We're Excited About This Partnership

**Content:**
```
Why [Partner Company]?

✓ [Specific strength they have—e.g., "Deep relationships with state/local government"]
✓ [Complementary capability—e.g., "Proven implementation expertise"]
✓ [Shared customer base—e.g., "Trusted by 500+ enterprise accounts we want to reach"]
✓ [Strategic alignment—e.g., "Commitment to customer outcomes over transactions"]

"We've done our homework. Here's why we think this could be transformational..."
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- This slide is CRITICAL—shows you're not giving a generic pitch
- Reference specific things from their website, earnings calls, press releases
- Name-drop mutual customers or connections if appropriate
- Compliment genuinely but don't overdo it

**Research Checklist Before Meeting:**
- [ ] Recent press releases or announcements
- [ ] Key executives and their backgrounds
- [ ] Existing partnerships they've announced
- [ ] Their strategic priorities (from earnings calls, interviews)
- [ ] Mutual customers or prospects
- [ ] Competitive partnerships they have

### Slide 4: The Problem We Solve

**Content:**
```
The Challenge Facing [Target Customer Segment]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   "Organizations struggle to [core problem]                 │
│    while managing [complexity factor] across                │
│    [scale factor—devices, locations, users]"                │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The Cost of the Status Quo:
• [Pain point 1]: $X lost annually per organization
• [Pain point 2]: X hours wasted per week
• [Pain point 3]: X% increase in risk/liability

Customers tell us: "[Direct quote from customer about the problem]"
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Use THEIR customers' language, not yours
- Quantify pain whenever possible—executives respond to dollars and time
- If you've done a discovery call, reference what they told you
- The quote should come from a real customer (anonymized if needed)

**Enterprise-Specific Pain Points to Reference:**
- Fragmented point solutions that don't integrate
- Compliance and audit complexity
- Training burden across distributed teams
- Long procurement cycles with no clear ROI proof
- Vendor management overhead

### Slide 14: Q&A / Discussion

**Content:**
```
Let's Discuss

Questions we often get:
• "How do you handle channel conflict?"
• "What's the real margin after discounting?"
• "How long until we see ROI on enablement?"
• "What support do we get on large deals?"

[Open space for discussion]

Contact:
[Name] | [Email] | [Phone]
[Name] | [Email] | [Phone]
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Don't rush Q&A—this is where deals are won or lost
- If no questions, ask: "What concerns would prevent you from moving forward?"
- Listen more than you talk
- Take notes on objections—these inform your proposal

---

## Objection Handling Guide

### "We're already partnered with [Competitor]"

**Response Framework:**
1. Acknowledge: "That makes sense—they're a strong player."
2. Differentiate: "What we're seeing is [specific trend] that's shifting the market..."
3. Offer coexistence: "Many partners work with multiple vendors. Here's how we complement..."
4. Provide proof: "Partner X had the same situation. Here's what happened..."

**Talk Track:**
> "I appreciate that. A lot of our best partners started the same way. What we've found is that [your solution] addresses [specific gap] that customers are increasingly asking for. Rather than replace your existing relationship, many partners position us as complementary for [specific use case]. Would it help to see how [similar partner] structured that?"

---

### "The economics don't work for us"

**Response Framework:**
1. Probe: "Help me understand what you're comparing against..."
2. Expand the view: "Have you factored in [services/renewals/expansion]?"
3. Reframe: "The total partner revenue per customer looks like..."
4. Prove it: "Here's what partners at your level typically generate..."

**Talk Track:**
> "That's important—if the math doesn't work, we shouldn't do this. Can you share what's not adding up? [Listen] I want to make sure you're looking at total revenue per customer, including services. Our partners typically see a [X:1] ratio of services to product revenue. On a $XXXk deal, that's $XXXk in services. Plus renewals at [X]% margin. Does that change the picture?"

---

### "We don't have bandwidth to enable on a new vendor"

**Response Framework:**
1. Empathize: "I hear that—enablement is a real investment."
2. Minimize: "Here's our fast-track approach..."
3. Support: "We'll provide [specific support] to reduce burden..."
4. Quick win: "What if we started with just [1-2 reps] on [1 opportunity]?"

**Talk Track:**
> "Totally fair. Nobody wants another certification program. Here's how we've addressed that: our fast-track program gets reps productive in [X days], not weeks. We'll come on-site (or virtual) and do the training. And we'll co-sell the first [X] deals with you—your team learns by doing with our support. Would a pilot with just 2-3 reps on a specific opportunity reduce the risk?"

---

### "Our customers are happy with their current solution"

**Response Framework:**
1. Agree: "That's great—happy customers are the goal."
2. Introduce change: "What we're seeing is [market shift]..."
3. Plant seeds: "When they start asking about [trend], we'd be well-positioned..."
4. Offer value now: "In the meantime, here's how we could add value..."

**Talk Track:**
> "That's the best situation to be in. What I'd ask is: what are you hearing about [emerging trend/requirement]? We're seeing more RFPs asking about [specific capability]. Our goal isn't to displace what's working—it's to make sure you have the answer when those questions come up. Would it be valuable to do a joint roadmap session with [X] customers who've mentioned this?"

---

### "We need to think about it"

**Response Framework:**
1. Understand: "Of course. What specifically do you need to evaluate?"
2. Offer help: "Would [specific resource] help with that decision?"
3. Create urgency: "The reason I mention timing is..."
4. Confirm next step: "Can we schedule a follow-up for [specific date]?"

**Talk Track:**
> "Absolutely—this is a big decision. To make sure I'm helpful, what are the main things you need to think through? [Listen] Would it help if I [specific offer]? One thing on timing: [relevant urgency—upcoming launch, limited capacity, etc.]. Could we schedule 30 minutes next [day] to reconnect?"
