# How to Use Templates

Every template in PartnerOS is designed to be customized for your specific situation. Here's how to get the most out of them.

---

## Understanding Placeholders

Templates use placeholders that you'll replace with your information:

| Placeholder | What to Replace With |
|-------------|---------------------|
| `[Your Company]` | Your company name |
| `[Partner Name]` | The partner's company name |
| `[Product]` | Your product or solution name |
| `$X` or `$[Amount]` | Specific dollar amounts |
| `[Date]` | Relevant dates |
| `[Name]` | Person's name |
| `[X]%` | Percentage values |

!!! example "Before & After"

    **Before:**
    ```markdown
    [Your Company] and [Partner Name] will collaborate to achieve $[X]
    in joint revenue by [Date].
    ```

    **After:**
    ```markdown
    Acme Corp and TechPartners Inc will collaborate to achieve $500,000
    in joint revenue by Q4 2025.
    ```

## Customization Levels

### Level 1: Quick Fill

Just replace the placeholders and use as-is.

**Best for:** Urgent needs, testing templates, small deals

### Level 2: Adapt Sections

Keep the structure but modify sections for your context:

- Remove sections that don't apply
- Add company-specific sections
- Adjust language to match your brand voice

**Best for:** Most use cases

### Level 3: Deep Customization

Use the template as inspiration to build your own:

- Reorganize the structure
- Add your frameworks and methodologies
- Integrate with your existing documents

**Best for:** Mature programs with established processes

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- **Read the "How to Use" section** at the top of each template
- **Customize for your audience** - A startup pitch differs from an enterprise pitch
- **Keep it concise** - Remove sections you don't need
- **Use your brand voice** - Adjust the tone to match your company
- **Version control** - Keep your customized templates in Git

### ❌ Don't

- **Don't use verbatim** - Templates are starting points, not final documents
- **Don't over-engineer** - Start simple, iterate based on feedback
- **Don't skip sections blindly** - Understand why each section exists before removing
- **Don't forget to update** - Revisit templates quarterly

## Template Sections Explained

Most templates follow this structure:

### YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Template Name
description: What this template does
keywords: [search, terms]
---
```

Used for search and organization. You can remove this in your customized version.
