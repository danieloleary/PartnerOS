# Appendix II: Conceptual Partner Program Maturity Model

This model helps teams assess where they are today and prioritize the templates and playbooks that will move the program forward. Use the checklist items as practical, actionable steps to level up.

---

## How to use this model
- **Read the stage descriptions** and pick the stage that most closely matches your current program.
- **Run the checklist** for each capability area (Strategy, Operations, Enablement, GTM & Sales, Data). Check off items you have implemented and prioritize the remaining items.
- **Apply templates**: each checklist item references specific templates or playbooks in the PartnerOS blueprint.

## Capability summary (quick view)

| Capability | Foundational | Emerging | Scaled | Optimized |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Strategy & Planning | Basic business case | Formal plan + tiers | OKRs, budgets, joint plans | Ecosystem-level strategy |
| Program Operations | Ad-hoc agreements | Standardized MSA & onboarding | PRM + automation | Integrated API & partner ops |
| Enablement | Minimal training | Structured onboarding + basics | Certifications + enablement roadmap | Continuous learning, partner academy |
| GTM & Sales | Opportunistic co-sell | Defined RoE + joint campaigns | Regular MD F + co-sell programs | Co-innovation + partner-led revenue |
| Data & Measurement | Manual reporting | KPIs defined (manual) | Automated dashboards & QBRs | Predictive insights & ecosystem ROI |

---

## Stage 1 — Foundational (Ad-hoc & Reactive)
**Characteristics:** opportunistic partner wins, no formal program, manual tracking, little enablement.

**Checklist (pick 3–5 quick wins):**
- Create a concise Partner Business Case (use `strategy/01-partner-business-case.md`).
- Define your Ideal Partner Profile (`strategy/02-ideal-partner-profile.md`).
- Create a Partner One-Pager for outreach (`II_Partner_Recruitment_Templates/06-one-pager.md`).
- Build a minimal Onboarding Checklist (from `recruitment/09-onboarding.md`).
- Start tracking basic revenue metrics (ARR/MRR) for partner deals.

**Suggested next step:** Move to Emerging by formalizing tiers and a basic Partner Playbook.

---

## Stage 2 — Emerging (Structured & Defined)
**Characteristics:** dedicated partner resource(s), tiered program, documented RoE and onboarding.

**Checklist:**
- Define partner tiers & benefits (`strategy/06-program-architecture.md`).
- Implement standard MSA & partner agreements templates (`partner_blueprint/`).
- Build a repeatable onboarding program and training deck (`enablement/02-training-deck.md`).
- Configure basic PRM/CRM flows and reporting for partner-sourced deals.
- Start running regular QBRs and ABRs.

**Suggested next step:** Invest in PRM tooling and enable certifications for partners.

---

## Stage 3 — Scaled (Proactive & Integrated)
**Characteristics:** specialized partner operations, automated reporting, consistent joint GTM programs.

**Checklist:**
- Implement automated dashboards and pipeline reporting for partners.
- Formalize MDF program and co-marketing playbooks (`enablement/04-co-marketing.md`).
- Create partner certification paths and a partner academy.
- Align sales incentives and RoE to support partner-led deals.
- Run quarterly QBRs with scorecards and action plans.

**Suggested next step:** Optimize partner onboarding and scale enablement content production.

---

## Stage 4 — Optimized (Ecosystem-Led & Innovative)
**Characteristics:** partners drive meaningful growth and co-innovation, program is a strategic asset.

**Checklist:**
- Build a partner community & advocacy programs (PACs, events).
- Measure ecosystem ROI and iterate on partner monetization strategies.
- Integrate partner flows into product roadmap (co-innovation pilots).
- Use predictive analytics to prioritize partners and opportunities.

**Suggested next step:** Shift budget and governance to support long-term ecosystem initiatives.

---

## Metrics to watch
- Partner-sourced ARR (monthly/quarterly)
- Partner contribution to pipeline (% of total pipeline)
- Partner onboarding completion rate
- Partner NPS and satisfaction (PSAT)
- Time-to-first-deal for new partners
