# Partner Business Case: CyberShield Inc.

## Executive Summary

### Core Recommendation

CyberShield Inc. should launch a structured channel partner program targeting managed service providers (MSPs) in the mid-market cybersecurity space. This initiative will enable us to achieve $3M in partner-influenced ARR within 24 months while reducing customer acquisition costs by 35% through channel leverage.

### Strategic Rationale & Urgency

The cybersecurity market for mid-market companies (500-5,000 employees) is projected to grow 18% CAGR through 2028. However, our direct sales team can only effectively cover 12% of this market. Meanwhile, competitor SentinelOne has grown their channel to contribute 40% of revenue in 18 months.

**Three forces make this urgent:**
1. **Market window**: MSPs are consolidating their vendor relationships now—missing this cycle means 3+ year wait
2. **Competitive pressure**: Three competitors have launched partner programs in our territory in the last 6 months
3. **Sales capacity**: Our enterprise team is at capacity; adding 5 more AEs would cost $750K/year vs. $180K for partner program

### Anticipated Impact & Key Metric

**Primary Metric:** $3M partner-influenced ARR by Q4 2027 (24 months from launch)

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Reduce CAC from $18,500 to $12,000 (35% reduction)
- Achieve 25% of revenue through partners by Year 3
- 15 active MSP partners by Month 18

### Investment Ask

**Total Investment:** $420,000 over 24 months

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Headcount (1 FTE Partner Manager) | $120,000 | $130,000 | $250,000 |
| Partner Enablement & Training | $45,000 | $25,000 | $70,000 |
| Marketing Development Funds | $30,000 | $40,000 | $70,000 |
| Technology (PRM, Portal) | $20,000 | $10,000 | $30,000 |
| **Total** | $215,000 | $205,000 | $420,000 |

**Expected Return:** $3M ARR ÷ $420K investment = **7.1x ROI**

## 1. Market Opportunity & Ecosystem Analysis

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):** $48B
- Global mid-market cybersecurity spending

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** $12B
- Mid-market companies in our geographic focus (North America)
- Companies with 500-5,000 employees
- Industries: Healthcare, Financial Services, Retail

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** $180M
- Realistic 5-year capture based on go-to-market capacity
- Assumes 1.5% market share of SAM

### Target Customer Segment Analysis

**Primary Segment: Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**

| Attribute | Our Target | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Size | 15-50 employees | Big enough to sell, small enough to partner |
| Revenue | $2M-$15M ARR | Growth-minded, investing in capabilities |
| Customer base | 50-300 SMBs | High volume, needs cybersecurity solutions |
| Technical capability | Can deploy & manage | Reduces our support burden |
| Sales model | Recurring revenue | Aligned incentives |

**Key Pain Points We're Solving:**
1. **Margin pressure**: MSPs need high-margin products; our 70% gross margin supports their model
2. **Client demands**: Their SMB clients increasingly require enterprise-grade security
3. **Competitive differentiation**: CyberShield gives them something competitors don't offer
4. **Support burden**: Our 24/7 SOC reduces their incident response workload

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Channel Model | Our Response |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| SentinelOne | Strong (40% revenue via channel) | Match program terms, better support |
| CrowdStrike | Emerging partner program | Faster onboarding, dedicated support |
| Sophos | Mature MSP program (10+ years) | Younger, more modern platform |
| Microsoft Defender | Self-service only | Personal relationship, customization |

**Our Differentiation in Channel:**
- 24/7 SOC support (competitors offer 8x5)
- Dedicated partner success manager (at Silver+)
- 15% higher partner margins than market average
- Co-marketing funds from Day 1

## 2. Strategic Rationale & Business Model

### Partnership Model

**Tiered Structure:**

| Tier | Revenue Target | Requirements | Commission |
|------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Registered | $0-$50K | Signed agreement | 15% |
| Silver | $50K-$200K | 2 certified reps, 5 deals | 20% |
| Gold | $200K+ | 5 certified reps, $50K MDF | 25% |

**Why This Works:**

1. **Low barrier to entry**: Any MSP can join at Registered tier
2. **Progression incentives**: Clear path to Silver/Gold drives behavior
3. **Protected margins**: Deal registration prevents price erosion

### Revenue Model

**Year 1 (Launch):**
- 5 Registered partners, 2 Silver
- $180K partner-influenced revenue
- Focus: Program validation, process refinement

**Year 2 (Scale):**
- 10 Registered, 5 Silver, 2 Gold
- $820K partner-influenced revenue
- Focus: Partner success, tier progression

**Year 3 (Optimize):**
- 15 Registered, 8 Silver, 4 Gold
- $2M partner-influenced revenue
- Focus: Gold partner expansion, new segment pilots
