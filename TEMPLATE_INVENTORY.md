## Architecture Notes

- **Single source of truth:** All templates live in `docs/` and are served by MkDocs
- **Legacy `partner_blueprint/` directory removed** — it was a near-identical copy with only link path differences
- **Agent and playbooks** now reference `docs/` directly via `templates_dir: ../../docs` in config
- **Private data** goes in `.partner_data/` (gitignored)
