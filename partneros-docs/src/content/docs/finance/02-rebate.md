## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
A rebate program supplements base commissions with back-end payments tied to
volume milestones — giving partners a reason to consolidate their pipeline
with you instead of a competitor.

**Steps:**
1. Set annual revenue targets for each rebate tier
2. Define rebate percentages (applied to total eligible revenue)
3. Establish the measurement period (calendar year, program year)
4. Communicate 6–8 weeks before program year starts
