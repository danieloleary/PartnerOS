This is where partner programs succeed or fail. A great product with bad compensation = no partners. This template gives you the complete picture.

:::tip[Insider Tip]

## What I Wish I Knew

The biggest mistake? Making comp too complex. Partners should be able to calculate earnings in their head.

The second mistake? Not adjusting for product margin. High-margin products can support higher commissions.

The third mistake? Ignoring churn clawbacks. They seem harsh but prevent gaming the system.
