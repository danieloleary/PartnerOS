> **Revenue sharing model for joint ventures, OEM relationships, and deep technology partnerships.**



## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
Revenue sharing differs from commissions in that both parties are co-owners of
the revenue stream, not vendor and referral partner. Use this for OEM/white-label
deals, co-built integrations, or joint GTM where both parties invest significantly.

**Steps:**
1. Define the joint offering or revenue stream
2. Agree on split rationale (investment, risk, ownership)
3. Define attribution and measurement
4. Establish governance cadence

# Revenue Sharing Model

**Agreement between:** [Company Name] and [Partner Name]
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Revenue Stream:** [Joint Product / OEM Bundle / White-Label Offering]

---

## OVERVIEW

This model governs how net revenue from the **[Joint Offering Name]** is split
between [Company] and [Partner]. Both parties contribute to the offering as
described below and share in its commercial success accordingly.

---

## CONTRIBUTION SUMMARY

| Party | Contribution | Revenue Share |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| [Company] | [Product, infrastructure, support] | [X]% |
| [Partner] | [Distribution, customer relationships, services] | [Y]% |
| **Total** | | **100%** |

### Rationale for Split

The [X/Y] split reflects:

- [Company] provides: [core platform, hosting, tier-1 support]
- [Partner] provides: [go-to-market, customer success, implementation]
- Market risk borne by: [Partner / both equally]

---

## REVENUE DEFINITION

### Gross Revenue

Total invoiced amounts for the joint offering, before any deductions.

### Net Revenue (basis for split)

Gross Revenue minus:

| Deduction | Amount / Rate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Payment processing fees | [2.5%] |
| Returns / refunds | Actual |
| Taxes collected on behalf of authorities | Actual |
| Co-op / MDF funded by [Company] | Actual |

> **Split is applied to Net Revenue, not Gross Revenue.**

### Revenue Exclusions

The following are excluded from the shared revenue pool:

- Professional services billed at full rate by either party independently
- Support contracts sold separately
- Hardware / third-party pass-through costs

---

## ATTRIBUTION MODEL

### How Revenue Is Attributed

| Scenario | Attributed To | Split Applied? |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Customer sourced by [Partner] | [Partner] | Yes |
| Customer sourced by [Company] | [Company] | Yes |
| Inbound / no clear source | Shared | Yes |
| Renewal of attributed deal | Original source | Yes |
| Upsell on attributed deal | Original source | Yes |

### Attribution Rules

## PAYMENT SCHEDULE

| Period | Revenue Recognized | Report Delivered | Payment Due |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Q1 | Jan–Mar | April 15 | April 30 |
| Q2 | Apr–Jun | July 15 | July 30 |
| Q3 | Jul–Sep | October 15 | October 30 |
| Q4 | Oct–Dec | January 15 | January 30 |

### Payment Method

| Year 2 | $[amount] | $[amount] |
| Year 3 | $[amount] | $[amount] |

**Shortfall remedy:** If either party misses by >[X]%, a joint remediation
plan is required within [30] days. Repeated misses (>[2] consecutive quarters)
are grounds for renegotiation or termination.
