> **The Problem:** Most partner programs fail not because of the partners — but because internal teams (Sales, Marketing, Product) weren't aligned. Sales ignores partners. Marketing doesn't support partner campaigns. Product won't build integrations. This template fixes that.

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:** Get your internal teams actually supporting the partner program — not just nodding in meetings.

**Before you start:**
- [ ] You have executive sponsorship (VP or above)
- [ ] You know which teams need to be involved
- [ ] You have 1:1 meetings scheduled with team leads

**Steps:**
1. List the stakeholders who can make or break your program
2. Identify what's in it for each team (their "why")
3. Define clear roles so no one guesses who's responsible
4. Create a communication rhythm (not just meetings)
5. Establish escalation paths for when things go wrong

# Internal Alignment Playbook

## The Hard Truth

Your partner program will fail if:

- **Sales** sees partners as competition for their deals
- **Marketing** treats partner leads as lower priority
- **Product** won't prioritize integration requests
- **Finance** drags on partner commission payments
- **Legal** blocks every partner agreement

This template helps you get ahead of all of it.

## 1. Stakeholder Map

### Who Needs to Be Aligned

| Team | Why They Matter | Typical Resistance |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Sales** | Source of partner deals, close them | "Partners steal my deals" |
| **Marketing** | Generate leads, create content | "Partners need too much hand-holding" |
| **Product** | Build integrations, APIs | "We have roadmap priorities" |
| **Finance** | Approve commissions, rebates | "Partner margins are too high" |
| **Legal** | Approve agreements | "Too much liability" |
| **Customer Success** | Support shared customers | "Partners create more work" |

### Exercise: Your Stakeholder Map

Write down:

1. **Who** is the decision-maker for each team?
2. **What** do they care about (quota, revenue, customer satisfaction)?
3. **What's** currently blocking them from supporting partners?
4. **Who** could be your internal champion?

## 2. The "What's In It For Me" Framework

### Sales Team

**Their concern:** "Partners compete with me for deals"

**Your solution:**
- Deal registration with protection (30-90 days)
- Co-sell commission bonus (extra 5-10%)
- Partner-sourced leads that don't count against quota
- "Win-win" language in every interaction

**Script to use:**
> "Hey [Sales Rep], I want to help you hit quota. Partners I bring in are YOUR leads — I'll help you close them, and you get full credit. Plus, when partners refer customers, they're warm intros, not cold calls."

### Marketing Team

**Their concern:** "Partner campaigns take too much work"

**Your solution:**
- Pre-built partner co-marketing assets
- Clear lead handoff process (don't make them do extra work)
- Partner-sourced leads get same treatment as outbound
- Recognition for partner-sourced pipeline

**Script to use:**
> "I've got co-marketing assets ready to go — you just approve, we execute. Plus, these leads come with context, so they're actually easier to convert."

### Product Team

**Their concern:** "Partner integrations aren't on the roadmap"

**Your solution:**
- Partner-requested integrations = customer demand signal
- Show revenue potential from partner ecosystem
- Integration requests go through you (filter the noise)
- Prioritize 2-3 high-impact integrations per quarter

**Script to use:**
> "This integration with [Partner] addresses requests from [X] customers. Here's the revenue impact. Can we get this on the Q2 roadmap?"

### Finance Team

**Their concern:** "Partner margins erode our revenue"

**Your solution:**
- Tiered commission structure (more for higher volume)
- Clear criteria for rebate programs
- Partner revenue tracked separately from direct sales
- Quarterly partner program ROI analysis

**Script to use:**
> "Partners drove 15% of Q1 revenue — that's $X. The commission expense is offset by lower CAC. Here's the breakdown."

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

### RACI Matrix

| Activity | Sales | Marketing | Product | Finance | Partner Manager |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Partner sourcing | R | A | - | - | C |
| Partner onboarding | C | R | C | C | A |
| Lead handoff | R | A | - | - | C |
| Deal registration | A | - | - | - | R |
| Commission payment | C | - | - | R | A |
| Contract review | C | C | C | C | A |

**R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted**

---

## 4. Communication Rhythm

### Weekly

- 15-min standup with partner team
- Pipeline review:哪些 partner deals in flight

### Monthly

- Cross-functional sync (Sales, Marketing, Product)
- Review metrics: partner-sourced leads, deal velocity, churn
- Flag blockers early

### Quarterly

- Executive review with VP+ attendance
- Set goals for next quarter
- Adjust commission/ rebate structures if needed

- Monthly: [Partner Success Metrics](../enablement/06-success-metrics/)
- Quarterly: [QBR Template](../enablement/07-qbr-template/)

## 5. Conflict Resolution

### Common Conflicts & How to Resolve Them

**"Sales won't share leads with partners"**
- Solution: Clear deal registration rules, enforced by leadership
- Script: "If we register the deal, we protect it for 60 days. That's fair."

**"Marketing won't prioritize partner campaigns"**
- Solution: Include partner pipeline in marketing metrics
- Script: "Partner leads are pipeline too — let's track them together."

**"Product won't build integrations"**
- Solution: Quantify revenue opportunity, prioritize 2-3 per quarter
- Script: "This integration unlocks [X] new potential customers."

**"Finance is slow on commissions"**
- Solution: Automate commission calculations, fixed payment dates
- Script: "Can we set up monthly auto-pay on the 15th?"

## 6. Success Metrics

Track these monthly:

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Partner-sourced leads | +20% MoM | Are we generating interest? |
| Partner deal velocity | < 45 days | Are deals closing? |
| Partner revenue | $X/quarter | Is the program producing? |
| Internal NPS | > 7 | Do teams actually support it? |
| Escalation resolution | < 5 days | Are we solving problems? |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too many stakeholders at once** — Start with Sales and Marketing. Add Product and Finance later.

2. **No executive sponsorship** — Without VP+ buy-in, you'll hit walls constantly.

3. **Meetings without action items** — If every sync is just "status updates," it's wasting time.

4. **Assuming alignment = agreement** — People will agree in meetings and then not do the work. Document decisions and follow up.

5. **No escalation path** — When something breaks, who decides? Have that answer BEFORE you need it.

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Start with one champion** in each department. Get them excited first. They'll sell it to their teams.

2. **Metrics first** — "We need to track partner-sourced revenue" is more persuasive than "we should care about partners."

3. **Assume good intent** — Most resistance isn't malice. It's fear of more work or loss of control. Address the fear.

4. **Celebrate wins publicly** — "Thanks to the Marketing team, partner leads up 30% this month!" Recognition drives behavior.

5. **Iterate quarterly** — Your first version will be wrong. That's fine. Review and adjust every quarter.
