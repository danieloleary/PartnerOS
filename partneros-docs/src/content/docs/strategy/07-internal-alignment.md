> **The Problem:** Most partner programs fail not because of the partners—but because internal teams (Sales, Marketing, Product) weren't aligned. Sales ignores partners. Marketing doesn't support partner campaigns. Product won't build integrations. This template fixes that. — Dan O'Leary

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The #1 killer of partner programs isn't external—it's internal politics. I've seen programs with perfect strategy die because Sales blocked every partner deal. Get alignment BEFORE you launch.
:::

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
This playbook helps you get internal teams actually supporting the partner program—not just nodding in meetings. It provides the frameworks, scripts, and processes to navigate cross-functional alignment.

**Why It Works:**
Internal alignment isn't a one-time event—it's an ongoing process. This playbook gives you the stakeholder map, scripts, RACI matrix, and conflict resolution frameworks to make alignment happen and keep it working.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] You have executive sponsorship (VP or above)
- [ ] You know which teams need to be involved
- [ ] You have 1:1 meetings scheduled with team leads

**Steps:**

1. **Map stakeholders** — Who can make or break your program? (30 min)
2. **Find their "why"** — What's in it for each team? (30 min)
3. **Define roles** — Clear RACI for every activity (30 min)
4. **Set communication rhythm** — Weekly, monthly, quarterly cadences (15 min)
5. **Build escalation paths** — How to resolve conflicts (15 min)

# Internal Alignment Playbook

## The Hard Truth

Your partner program will fail if:

- **Sales** sees partners as competition for their deals
- **Marketing** treats partner leads as lower priority
- **Product** won't prioritize integration requests
- **Finance** drags on partner commission payments
- **Legal** blocks every partner agreement

This template helps you get ahead of all of it.

:::caution[EXPECT RESISTANCE]
Every internal stakeholder will have objections. That's normal. The goal isn't to eliminate resistance—it's to address it with solutions, not just promises.

## 1. Stakeholder Map

### Who Needs to Be Aligned

Every team has different incentives. Understanding theirs is the first step to alignment.

| Team | Why They Matter | Typical Resistance |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Sales** | Source of partner deals, close them | "Partners steal my deals" |
| **Marketing** | Generate leads, create content | "Partners need too much hand-holding" |
| **Product** | Build integrations, APIs | "We have roadmap priorities" |
| **Finance** | Approve commissions, rebates | "Partner margins are too high" |
| **Legal** | Approve agreements | "Too much liability" |
| **Customer Success** | Support shared customers | "Partners create more work" |

### Exercise: Your Stakeholder Map

Write down for each team:

1. **Who** is the decision-maker?
2. **What** do they care about (quota, revenue, customer satisfaction)?
3. **What's** currently blocking them from supporting partners?
4. **Who** could be your internal champion?

**Example stakeholder map:**
```markdown
## Sales - VP of Sales (Marcus)

- What he cares about: Quota attainment, team performance
- Current block: "Partners compete for my deals"
- Solution: Deal registration with protection, partner-sourced leads don't affect quota
- Champion: Could be Marcus if we show pipeline impact
```

## 2. The "What's In It For Me" Framework

### Sales Team

**Their concern:** "Partners compete with me for deals"

This is the most common resistance—and the most dangerous. If Sales sees partners as competition, they'll block every deal.

**Your solution:**

- Deal registration with protection (30-90 days)
- Co-sell commission bonus (extra 5-10%)
- Partner-sourced leads that don't count against quota
- "Win-win" language in every interaction

**Script to use:**
> "Hey [Sales Rep], I want to help you hit quota. Partners I bring in are YOUR leads—I'll help you close them, and you get full credit. Plus, when partners refer customers, they're warm intros, not cold calls."

**The deal registration conversation:**
When Sales pushes back, ask: "What's fair?" Get them to define what protection looks like. Usually, once they articulate the rules, they're more willing to follow them.

### Marketing Team

**Their concern:** "Partner campaigns take too much work"

Marketing teams are already stretched. Partners feel like extra work. Your job is to make it easy.

**Your solution:**

- Pre-built partner co-marketing assets (don't ask them to create)
- Clear lead handoff process (don't make them do extra work)
- Partner-sourced leads get same treatment as outbound
- Recognition for partner-sourced pipeline

**Script to use:**
> "I've got co-marketing assets ready to go—you just approve, we execute. Plus, these leads come with context, so they're actually easier to convert."

### Product Team

**Their concern:** "Partner integrations aren't on the roadmap"

Product teams getIntegration requests constantly. Partners are one more ask in a sea of asks.

**Your solution:**

- Partner-requested integrations = customer demand signal
- Show revenue potential from partner ecosystem
- Integration requests go through you (filter the noise)
- Prioritize 2-3 high-impact integrations per quarter

**Script to use:**
> "This integration with [Partner] addresses requests from [X] customers. Here's the revenue impact. Can we get this on the Q2 roadmap?"

### Finance Team

**Their concern:** "Partner margins erode our revenue"

Finance thinks about margins and profitability. Partners are a cost center until proven otherwise.

**Your solution:**

- Tiered commission structure (more for higher volume)
- Clear criteria for rebate programs
- Partner revenue tracked separately from direct sales
- Quarterly partner program ROI analysis

**Script to use:**
> "Partners drove 15% of Q1 revenue—that's $X. The commission expense is offset by lower CAC. Here's the breakdown."

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

### RACI Matrix

Clear roles prevent "who owns this?" debates. Use RACI: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed.

| Activity | Sales | Marketing | Product | Finance | Partner Manager |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Partner sourcing | R | A | - | - | C |
| Partner onboarding | C | R | C | C | A |
| Lead handoff | R | A | - | - | C |
| Deal registration | A | - | - | - | R |
| Commission payment | C | - | - | R | A |
| Contract review | C | C | C | C | A |
| Integration prioritization | C | - | R | - | A |

**R = Responsible (does the work), A = Accountable (ultimate owner), C = Consulted**

### Common Role Debates

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Who owns partner leads? | Sales owns closing; Partner Manager owns sourcing |
| Who approves partner contracts? | Legal reviews; Partner Manager recommends |
| Who decides on commissions? | Finance calculates; VP Sales approves |
| Who prioritizes integrations? | Product owns roadmap; Partner Manager provides input |

---

## 4. Communication Rhythm

### Weekly

- 15-min standup with partner team
- Pipeline review: which partner deals are in flight
- Blockers and escalations

### Monthly

- Cross-functional sync (Sales, Marketing, Product)
- Review metrics: partner-sourced leads, deal velocity, churn
- Flag blockers early
- Review partner program health

### Quarterly

- Executive review with VP+ attendance
- Set goals for next quarter
- Adjust commission/rebate structures if needed
- Annual planning input

### Templates to Use

| Cadence | Template | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Weekly | [Partner Pipeline Template](../operations/03-monthly-report/) | Track in-flight deals |
| Monthly | [Partner Success Metrics](../enablement/06-success-metrics/) | Track program health |
| Quarterly | [QBR Template](../enablement/07-qbr-template/) | Executive review |

## 5. Conflict Resolution

### Common Conflicts & How to Resolve Them

**"Sales won't share leads with partners"**

- Solution: Clear deal registration rules, enforced by leadership
- Script: "If we register the deal, we protect it for 60 days. That's fair."
- Escalation: VP Sales makes final call

**"Marketing won't prioritize partner campaigns"**

- Solution: Include partner pipeline in marketing metrics
- Script: "Partner leads are pipeline too—let's track them together."
- Escalation: CMO sets quarterly priorities

**"Product won't build integrations"**

- Solution: Quantify revenue opportunity, prioritize 2-3 per quarter
- Script: "This integration unlocks [X] new potential customers."
- Escalation: CPO reviews quarterly

**"Finance is slow on commissions"**

- Solution: Automate commission calculations, fixed payment dates
- Script: "Can we set up monthly auto-pay on the 15th?"
- Escalation: CFO sets payment terms

### Escalation Framework

| Issue Type | First Escalation | Second Escalation |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Deal conflict | Partner Manager | VP Sales |
| Campaign priority | Marketing Lead | CMO |
| Integration request | Product Manager | CPO |
| Commission delay | Finance Manager | CFO |

## 6. Success Metrics

### Internal Alignment Metrics

Track these monthly to measure if alignment is working:

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Partner-sourced leads | +20% MoM | Is Marketing generating interest? |
| Partner deal velocity | < 45 days | Are Sales closing partner deals? |
| Partner revenue | $X/quarter | Is the program producing? |
| Internal NPS | > 7 | Do teams actually support it? |
| Escalation resolution | < 5 days | Are we solving problems? |
| Deal registration approval | < 2 days | Are Sales respecting the process? |

### Partner vs. Direct Comparison

| Metric | Partner | Direct | Parity Target |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Win rate | >40% | >40% | Parity |
| Deal size | >$50K | >$50K | Within 20% |
| Sales cycle | <60 days | <60 days | Within 25% |
| Customer satisfaction | >8.0 | >8.0 | Parity |

## What I Wish I Knew

**One champion beats ten stakeholders:**
Early in my career, I tried to get everyone aligned at once. Now I find ONE champion in each department—someone excited about partners—and let them sell it internally. Consensus follows influence, not logic.

**Assume good intent:**
Most resistance isn't malice. It's fear—of more work, loss of control, or failure. Address the fear, not the person.

**Metrics beat promises:**
"We should care about partners" doesn't persuade. "Partners drove 15% of Q1 revenue" does. Lead with data.

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Too Many Stakeholders at Once**
- **What happens:** Everyone's involved, no one's accountable
- **Warning sign:** Meetings with 10+ people
- **Prevention:** Start with Sales and Marketing only. Add Product and Finance later.

**Pitfall #2: No Executive Sponsorship**
- **What happens:** You'll hit walls constantly
- **Warning sign:** VP not attending quarterly reviews
- **Prevention:** Get VP+ sponsorship BEFORE launching

**Pitfall #3: Meetings Without Action Items**
- **What happens:** Status updates waste time
- **Warning sign:** Same issues discussed for 3+ weeks
- **Prevention:** Every meeting ends with specific action items and owners

**Pitfall #4: Assuming Alignment = Agreement**
- **What happens:** People agree in meetings, then don't execute
- **Warning sign:** Decisions made but not implemented
- **Prevention:** Document decisions, follow up weekly

**Pitfall #5: No Escalation Path**
- **What happens:** Conflicts fester, deals stall
- **Warning sign:** Same conflicts unresolved for months
- **Prevention:** Define escalation BEFORE you need it
