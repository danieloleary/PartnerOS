This is your program's founding document. It answers: Why do we exist? What do we believe? How will we operate? Who decides?

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The best partner charters are one page. If your executive team can't read it in 5 minutes, it's too long. CFOs approve clarity, not complexity.

## How to Use This Template

The Partner Program Charter is typically created during program design and approved by executive leadership before recruitment begins. It serves as the constitution for your program.

### Why It Works

Without a charter, programs drift. Different leaders have different expectations. A charter creates alignment and accountability from day one.

### Choose Your Level

| Level | Time | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Quick Win** | 1 hr | Startup charter, small team |
| **Standard** | 4 hrs | Mid-market program |
| **Executive** | 6 hrs | Enterprise board approval |

---

## Program Mission & Vision

### Mission Statement

Define why your partner program exists. One sentence that captures your purpose.

**Example:** "To build a world-class ecosystem of partners who deliver exceptional customer outcomes while growing profitable revenue together."

### Vision Statement

Where do you want your partner program to be in 3-5 years?

**Example:** "Become the #1 partner ecosystem in our market, with 100+ active partners driving 40% of company revenue."

### Values

What principles guide your partner relationships?

| Value | Definition | Behavior |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Partnership First** | We win together | No competing with partners |
| **Transparency** | Open communication | Share pipeline and strategy |
| **Excellence** | Best-in-class | Only recruit best-fit partners |
| **Growth** | Mutual success | Invest in partner success |

## What I Wish I Knew

The biggest mistake? Writing a charter no one reads. Keep it to one page if possible—executives appreciate brevity.

The second mistake? Not getting sign-off from Sales. If VP Sales isn't aligned, your program will face constant friction.

The third mistake? Setting unrealistic targets. Conservative targets you exceed build more trust than ambitious targets you miss.
