> **How you end partnerships matters as much as how you start them. A messy exit creates enemies; a graceful exit creates potential future allies.** — Dan O'Leary

:::caution[DON'T TERMINATE BEFORE READING THIS]
Exiting a partner improperly can cost you customers, create legal liability, and damage your reputation. Follow this checklist meticulously. If you're rushing, you're making mistakes.
:::

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
This checklist ensures a professional, thorough, and legally sound termination process that protects all parties—your company, your customers, and even the departing partner.

**Why It Works:**
Partner exits are emotional. People get defensive, cut corners, and make hasty decisions. This checklist ensures nothing falls through the cracks and you maintain your reputation even when ending relationships.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Exit approved by executive sponsor
- [ ] Legal review of contract terms completed
- [ ] Business impact assessment done
- [ ] Communication plan drafted

**Steps:**

1. **Confirm exit is appropriate** — Review triggers, consider alternatives (1 hour)
2. **Assemble exit team** — Assign roles and responsibilities (30 min)
3. **Execute each phase** — Pre-exit, notification, transition, post-exit (1-2 hours)
4. **Document everything** — Communications, decisions, learnings (ongoing)
5. **Conduct post-exit review** — Capture learnings for future (30 min)

# Partner Exit Checklist

## When to Use This Checklist

### Exit Triggers

Not every performance issue warrants termination. Use this framework to decide:

| Trigger Category | Examples | Urgency | Action |
|------------------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Performance** | Consistently missing targets, declining engagement | Medium | Improvement plan first |
| **Strategic** | Market pivot, M&A, program restructuring | Low-Medium | Planned wind-down |
| **Compliance** | Contract breach, ethical violations | High | Immediate review |
| **Mutual** | Both parties agree to end relationship | Low | Collaborative exit |
| **Business** | Partner bankruptcy, acquisition by competitor | High | Emergency protocol |
| **Customer Impact** | Partner harming customer relationships | High | Immediate action |

### Exit Decision Framework

Before proceeding, confirm:

- [ ] Exit approved by executive sponsor
- [ ] Alternative remediation options considered
- [ ] Business impact assessment completed
- [ ] Legal counsel reviewed the situation
- [ ] Communication plan drafted
- [ ] Customer transition plan in place

:::tip EXIT vs. IMPROVEMENT
If the issue is fixable, try a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) first. 90 days of documented improvement is better than an exit that disrupts customers.

## Exit Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Underperforming Partner

**Situation:** Partner consistently misses targets, low engagement

**Approach:** Graduated wind-down with warning period

1. Document performance gaps over 6+ months
2. Create formal performance improvement plan (30-90 days)
3. If no improvement, provide termination notice
4. Standard 30-day transition timeline
5. Offer to stay connected informally

### Scenario 2: Contract Breach

**Situation:** Partner violated agreement terms

**Approach:** Expedited exit with legal protection

1. Document breach with evidence
2. Legal review and guidance
3. Termination for cause notice (shorter notice period)
4. Accelerated access revocation (within 48 hours)
5. Preserve evidence for potential dispute

### Scenario 3: Mutual Agreement

**Situation:** Both parties agree partnership isn't working

**Approach:** Collaborative wind-down

1. Joint discussion on terms
2. Mutually agreed timeline
3. Positive external messaging
4. Reference-friendly separation
5. Leave door open for future

### Scenario 4: Partner Acquisition by Competitor

## What I Wish I Knew

**The customer call is the hardest part:**
I used to delay customer notifications, thinking I could handle them later. That was wrong. Customers hear about the exit from the partner, not from you—and then you're defensive. Notify customers proactively.

**Document everything:**
Every conversation, every email, every decision. If the exit becomes contentious, documentation is your protection. If it's amicable, documentation helps future improvements.

**Leave on good terms if possible:**
You never know when paths will cross again. The partner landscape is small. A graceful exit today could be a valuable relationship tomorrow.

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Delayed Notification**
- **What happens:** Partner hears from customers before you
- **Warning sign:** Partner calls you asking what's happening
- **Prevention:** Notify partner day 0, before any customer communication

**Pitfall #2: Incomplete Access Revocation**
- **What happens:** Partner retains portal access, continues seeing data
- **Warning sign:** System access audit shows active credentials
- **Prevention:** Full access audit within 72 hours of termination

**Pitfall #3: Ignoring Customer Transitions**
- **What happens:** Customers left hanging, blame you
- **Warning sign:** Customer complaints post-exit
- **Prevention:** Every customer has named transition owner

**Pitfall #4: No Post-Exit Review**
- **What happens:** Same mistakes repeat with next exit
- **Warning sign:** Similar issues in subsequent exits
- **Prevention:** Mandatory post-exit review within 30 days
