This template walks you through building a business case that will get CFO approval. Every section is designed to answer the questions executives actually ask—and use the metrics they actually care about. This is not a generic template. It's built from what works in real boardrooms.

> **"The biggest mistake I see in partner business cases is asking for money without proving ROI. Every number in this document traces back to a specific revenue assumption. That's how you get buy-in from CFOs."**
> — Dan O'Leary, PartnerOS

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The "Do Nothing" scenario is your secret weapon. CFOs are risk-averse—showing them the cost of inaction often works better than showing the upside. See Section 7 for how to frame this.
:::

## How to Use This Template

This template is built around what actually gets approved. It addresses the CFO's ROI concerns, the CEO's strategic questions, and the VP Sales' channel conflict fears—all in one document.

### Choose Your Level

| Level | Time | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| Quick Win | 2 hours | Pilot program, small budget request |
| Standard | 8 hours | Full program launch |
| Strategic | 16 hours | Board-level approval, major investment |

### Key Terms Used

This template uses specific terminology from the Partner Program Glossary. Understanding these terms ensures your business case sounds like an expert wrote it:

- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market) - The total market opportunity
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market) - Your addressable segment
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) - Realistic capture
- **ARR** (Annual Recurring Revenue) - Your revenue metric
- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost) - Cost to acquire customers
- **LTV** (Lifetime Value) - Customer lifetime value
- **MDF** (Marketing Development Funds) - Co-marketing budget
- **QBR** (Quarterly Business Review) - Partner check-in cadence

See the Partner Program Glossary for complete definitions.

## What I Wish I Knew Before I Started

**The #1 reason business cases fail:** They ask for money without proving ROI. Every financial projection must trace to a specific assumption—never present a number you can't defend.

**The question that closes CFOs:** "What's the payback period?" If you can't answer this in under 24 months, your case is weak.

**The mistake that kills programs:** Launching without executive sponsorship. If you don't have a C-level champion, don't start.

**What actually gets approved:**
- Clear ROI (not just revenue projections)
- Phased approach (not everything at once)
- Easy wins in first 90 days
- Risk mitigation (not just risk identification)

## Quick Win Checklist

*Complete these first—can be done in 2 hours*

- [ ] Executive Summary (1 page max)
- [ ] Financial Overview (Revenue - Cost = Profit)
- [ ] One-pager for CEO
- [ ] Basic risk assessment

---

## Executive Summary

The Executive Summary is the only section most executives will read. Make it count. It should stand alone as a one-page document that answers: What do you want? Why should they care? What's the cost? What's the return?

### Core Recommendation

In 2-3 concise sentences, what is the specific partnership initiative being proposed, and what primary business objective does it address?

**Example:** "We recommend launching a co-sell program with strategic ISVs in the cybersecurity space to penetrate the enterprise FSI market and accelerate new logo acquisition. This initiative will generate $3M in partner-influenced ARR within 24 months while reducing customer acquisition costs by 35%."

### Strategic Rationale and Urgency

Why is this initiative critical for our business now? What market forces, competitive pressures, or unique opportunities necessitate this action?

**Example:** "Three forces make this urgent: (1) Market window—MSPs are consolidating vendor relationships now, missing this cycle means 3+ year wait; (2) Competitive pressure—three competitors have launched partner programs in our territory in the last 6 months; (3) Sales capacity—our enterprise team is at capacity, adding 5 more AEs would cost $750K/year vs. $180K for this program."

### Anticipated Impact and Key Metric

What is the single most significant, measurable outcome expected?

| Metric | Target | Timeline | Definition |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Partner-Influenced ARR | $3M | 24 months | Total ARR from partner-sourced and influenced deals |
| CAC Reduction | 35% | 24 months | (Direct CAC - Partner CAC) ÷ Direct CAC |
| Active Partners | 20 | 18 months | Partners with at least one deal in last 6 months |

### Investment Ask

What is the high-level resource commitment required?

The table below breaks down the investment over two years. Note that Year 1 focuses on foundation (hiring, tooling, initial recruitment), while Year 2 scales the program.

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Headcount (1 FTE Partner Manager) | $120,000 | $130,000 | $250,000 |
| Partner Enablement and Training | $45,000 | $25,000 | $70,000 |
| MDF | $30,000 | $40,000 | $70,000 |
| Technology (PRM, Portal) | $20,000 | $10,000 | $30,000 |
| **Total** | **$215,000** | **$205,000** | **$420,000** |

**Expected ROI:** $3M ÷ $420K = **7.1x**

:::tip
When presenting the Investment Ask, always lead with the total and then break it down. Executives want to see the number first, then understand the components.

## Market Opportunity and Ecosystem Analysis

This section establishes the market context. You're proving there's a real opportunity worth chasing—and that you understand it better than anyone.

### Total Addressable Market

Define your market opportunity using the standard framework: TAM, SAM, and SOM. Each level has a specific purpose in your argument.

| Level | Definition | Amount | Source |
|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| TAM | Total Addressable Market | $48B | Gartner 2025 |
| SAM | Serviceable Addressable Market | $12B | Geographic focus: North America |
| SOM | Serviceable Obtainable Market | $180M | 1.5% market share assumption |

**What each level means:**
- **TAM** is the ceiling—the total market if everyone used your product
- **SAM** is what you can actually reach with your go-to-market
- **SOM** is what you can realistically capture given competition and capacity

### Target Customer Segment Analysis

Who are your ideal partners? This isn't about your end customers—it's about the partners who will sell on your behalf.

| Attribute | Target | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Company Size | 15-50 employees | Big enough to sell, small enough to partner |
| Revenue | $2M-$15M ARR | Growth-minded, investing in capabilities |
| Customer Base | 50-300 SMBs | High volume, needs your solution |
| Technical Capability | Can deploy and manage | Reduces your support burden |
| Sales Model | Recurring revenue | Aligned incentives |

**Key Pain Points You're Solving:**

1. **Margin pressure**: They need high-margin products; your 70% gross margin supports their model
2. **Client demands**: Their customers increasingly require enterprise-grade capabilities
3. **Competitive differentiation**: You give them something competitors don't offer
4. **Support burden**: Your 24/7 support reduces their workload

### Competitive Landscape

Understanding how competitors approach the channel informs your differentiation strategy.

| Competitor | Channel Model | Their Strength | Your Response |
|------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| SentinelOne | 40% via channel | Scale, brand recognition | Better support, faster onboarding |
| CrowdStrike | Emerging | Market leadership | Dedicated partner success manager |
| Sophos | Mature (10+ years) | Partner trust | Modern platform, better margins |
| Microsoft Defender | Self-service only | Distribution | Personal relationship, customization |

---

## Strategic Alignment and Internal Readiness

This section answers: "Why should we do this now, and why can't we just do it ourselves?" It also addresses the political reality of internal alignment.

### CFO Language: The ROI Argument

For your CFO, emphasize numbers they can verify. CFOs speak the language of returns, payback, and risk mitigation.

- **Payback period**: "Breaks even in 18 months"
- **ROI**: "2.3x return over 3 years"
- **Risk mitigation**: "Phased investment minimizes exposure"
- **Cost efficiency**: "vs. $750K for 5 additional AEs"

### CEO Language: The Growth Argument

For your CEO, emphasize growth, market share, and competitive positioning. CEOs think in terms of market capture and competitive moats.

- **Market share**: "Competitor X has 40% revenue via channel—we're at 0%"
- **Competitive moat**: "First-mover advantage in our vertical"
- **Scalability**: "Revenue at scale without headcount linear growth"
- **Speed**: "Go to market 6 months faster than building direct"

### VP Sales Language: The Partnership Argument

For VP Sales, address their fears about channel conflict head-on. Show you understand their concerns.

- **No conflict**: "Deal registration prevents channel conflict"
- **New pipeline**: "Partners sell to ICP we can't reach"
- **Coverage**: "3x pipeline coverage from channel"
- **Support**: "No displacement of direct sales"

### Cross-Functional Impact

Every new initiative affects other teams. Map the impact and your mitigation plan.

| Department | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Sales | Some direct deals may shift to partners | Clear territory rules, deal registration |
| Marketing | Additional collateral needs | Allocate 10% to co-marketing |
| Support | Increased ticket volume | Partner training reduces escalation |
| Finance | Commission processing | Automate via CRM integration |
| Legal | Contract templates needed | Reuse existing MSA template |

:::caution
If you can't get VP Sales on board, don't proceed. Channel conflict will kill your program before it starts.

## ROI and Financial Model

This is the heart of your business case. Every number must be traceable to an assumption. If you can't explain where a number comes from, remove it.

### Revenue Projections

Here's a 3-year projection based on realistic partner acquisition and productivity curves. Notice how partner productivity increases over time as they mature.

| Year | Partners | Partner Revenue | Commission | Net Revenue |
|------|---------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Y1 | 7 | $180,000 | $27,000 | $153,000 |
| Y2 | 17 | $820,000 | $164,000 | $656,000 |
| Y3 | 27 | $2,000,000 | $450,000 | $1,550,000 |
| **Total** | — | $3,000,000 | $641,000 | $2,359,000 |

### Cost Model

These costs include everything needed to launch and scale the program. Year 1 is heavier due to foundational investments.

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Partner Manager (1 FTE) | $120,000 | $130,000 | $140,000 | $390,000 |
| Enablement/Training | $45,000 | $25,000 | $20,000 | $90,000 |
| MDF (15% of partner rev) | $27,000 | $123,000 | $300,000 | $450,000 |
| Technology/Platform | $20,000 | $20,000 | $22,000 | $62,000 |
| Marketing Collateral | $15,000 | $10,000 | $10,000 | $35,000 |
| **Total Cost** | **$227,000** | **$308,000** | **$492,000** | **$1,027,000** |

### ROI Summary

This is the number your CFO is waiting for. Make it prominent.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Investment | $1,027,000 |
| Total Net Revenue | $2,359,000 |
| **Net Profit** | **$1,332,000** |
| **ROI** | **2.3x** |
| **Payback Period** | **18 months** |

### Sensitivity Analysis

Always show you understand risk. Present conservative, base, and optimistic scenarios.

| Scenario | Revenue | Cost | Profit | ROI |
|----------|---------|------|--------|-----|
| Conservative (60%) | $1,415,000 | $1,027,000 | $388,000 | 1.4x |
| Base Case (100%) | $2,359,000 | $1,027,000 | $1,332,000 | 2.3x |
| Optimistic (140%) | $3,303,000 | $1,027,000 | $2,276,000 | 3.2x |

**Even in conservative scenario, program breaks even in Year 2.**

### Key Metrics to Track

These are the KPIs that prove your program is working. Track these monthly.

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Partner-Influenced Revenue | 30% of total | Marked deals in CRM |
| Time to Revenue | < 90 days | First deal date - contract signed |
| NPS | 50+ | Quarterly survey via PRM |
| CAC Reduction | 35% | (Direct CAC - Partner CAC) ÷ Direct CAC |

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

Executives respect honesty about risk. The question isn't "are there risks?"—it's "can you manage them?"

### Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: No Revenue in 18 Months**
- **What happens:** Executive sponsor loses patience, budget gets cut
- **Warning sign:** Partners signed but no deals after 6 months
- **Prevention:** Set milestone checkpoints every 90 days; have contingency plan

**Pitfall #2: Channel Conflict**
- **What happens:** Sales team blocks partner deals, program stalls
- **Warning sign:** Sales team not referring leads to partners
- **Prevention:** Deal registration system, clear territory rules, VP Sales involved from day 1

- **Prevention:** Clear value proposition, regular QBRs, tier advancement path

- **Channel conflict** | Medium | Medium | Deal registration, protected territories |
| Key partner churn | Low | High | Multi-partner strategy, no single dominant |
| Market shift | Low | High | Quarterly reviews, flexibility |
| Operational complexity | High | Medium | Phased rollout, clear processes |

### Worst Case Scenario

- Only 5 partners active by Year 2
- $500K revenue vs. $820K projected
- Program continues with reduced scope
- No additional investment required

:::tip
Always include a worst-case scenario. It shows you've thought through what could go wrong—and builds trust.

## Implementation Plan

A phased approach reduces risk and builds momentum. Every phase should have clear milestones and success criteria.

### Phased Rollout

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)**

| Week | Activity | Owner |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1-2 | Finalize partner agreement templates | Legal |
| 1-2 | Configure CRM for partner tracking | Sales Ops |
| 3-4 | Develop partner pitch deck | Marketing |
| 3-4 | Identify top 20 targets | Sales |
| 5-8 | Recruit first 5 beta partners | Partner Manager |
| 9-12 | Launch beta program | All |

**Phase 2: Scale (Months 4-12)**
- Onboard 10 additional partners
- Launch co-marketing campaigns
- Establish partner advisory board
- First tier promotions

**Phase 3: Optimize (Months 13-24)**
- Expand to Gold tier partners
- Launch new segment (VARs)
- Develop certification program
- Annual partner summit

### Success Metrics

Track these metrics at each milestone to prove the program is working.

| Metric | Month 6 | Month 12 | Month 24 |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Active Partners | 5 | 12 | 20 |
| Partner Revenue | $50K | $180K | $820K |
| Partner-Influenced Revenue | $120K | $420K | $2M |
| CAC Reduction | 10% | 25% | 35% |

---

## The "Do Nothing" Scenario

This is your secret weapon. CFOs are trained to say no to new initiatives. Make the cost of inaction louder than the cost of action.

### Consequences of Inaction

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Revenue | Missed $3M in partner-influenced ARR |
| Market Share | Competitors capture 40% of channel market |
| CAC | Remain at $18,500 vs. $12,000 target |
| Competitive | Lose first-mover advantage for 3+ years |

### Opportunity Cost

- 18 months of market penetration lost
- Partner relationships go to competitors
- Sales capacity constrained without channel leverage

---

## Executive Approval

### Sign-Off

| Role | Name | Date |
|------|------|------|
| CEO | | |
| CFO | | |
| VP Sales | | |
| VP Marketing | | |

### Next Steps

1. Approve $215,000 Year 1 budget
2. Post Partner Manager job description
3. Finalize partner agreement by [Date]
4. Target program launch: [Date]
