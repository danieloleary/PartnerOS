> **"The biggest mistake I see in partner business cases is asking for money without proving ROI. Every number in this document traces back to a specific revenue assumption. That's how you get buy-in from CFOs."**
> — Dan O'Leary, PartnerOS

:::tip INSIDER TIP
The "Do Nothing" scenario is your secret weapon. CFOs are risk-averse—showing them the cost of inaction often works better than showing the upside.
:::

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
Build a business case that convinces executives to fund your partner program—using their language, their metrics, and their risk tolerance.

**Why It Works:**
This template is built around what actually gets approved. It addresses the CFO's ROI concerns, the CEO's strategic questions, and the VP Sales' channel conflict fears—all in one document.

**Choose Your Level:**

| Level | Time | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| Quick Win | 2 hours | Pilot program, small budget request |
| Standard | 8 hours | Full program launch |
| Strategic | 16 hours | Board-level approval, major investment |

# Partner Business Case Template

## What I Wish I Knew Before I Started

**The #1 reason business cases fail:** They ask for money without proving ROI. Every financial projection must trace to a specific assumption—never present a number you can't defend.

**The question that closes CFOs:** "What's the payback period?" If you can't answer this in under 24 months, your case is weak.

**The mistake that kills programs:** Launching without executive sponsorship. If you don't have a C-level champion, don't start.

**What actually gets approved:**
- Clear ROI (not just revenue projections)
- Phased approach (not everything at once)
- Easy wins in first 90 days
- Risk mitigation (not just risk identification)

## 1. Executive Summary

### Core Recommendation

*In 2-3 concise sentences, what is the specific partnership initiative being proposed, and what primary business objective does it address?*

**Example:** "We recommend launching a co-sell program with strategic ISVs in the cybersecurity space to penetrate the enterprise FSI market and accelerate new logo acquisition. This initiative will generate $3M in partner-influenced ARR within 24 months while reducing customer acquisition costs by 35%."

### Strategic Rationale & Urgency

*Why is this initiative critical for our business now? What market forces, competitive pressures, or unique opportunities necessitate this action?*

**Example:** "Three forces make this urgent: (1) Market window—MSPs are consolidating vendor relationships now, missing this cycle means 3+ year wait; (2) Competitive pressure—three competitors have launched partner programs in our territory in the last 6 months; (3) Sales capacity—our enterprise team is at capacity, adding 5 more AEs would cost $750K/year vs. $180K for this program."

### Anticipated Impact & Key Metric

*What is the single most significant, measurable outcome expected?*

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Partner-Influenced ARR | $3M | 24 months |
| CAC Reduction | 35% | 24 months |
| Active Partners | 20 | 18 months |

### Investment Ask

*What is the high-level resource commitment required?*

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Headcount (1 FTE Partner Manager) | $120,000 | $130,000 | $250,000 |
| Partner Enablement & Training | $45,000 | $25,000 | $70,000 |
| Marketing Development Funds | $30,000 | $40,000 | $70,000 |
| Technology (PRM, Portal) | $20,000 | $10,000 | $30,000 |
| **Total** | $215,000 | $205,000 | $420,000 |

**Expected ROI:** $3M ÷ $420K = **7.1x**

## 2. Market Opportunity & Ecosystem Analysis

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

*Define TAM, SAM, and SOM for this specific partner motion with specific numbers.*

| Level | Definition | Amount | Source |
|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| TAM | Total Addressable Market | $48B | Gartner 2025 |
| SAM | Serviceable Addressable Market | $12B | Geographic focus: North America |
| SOM | Serviceable Obtainable Market | $180M | 1.5% market share assumption |

### Target Customer Segment Analysis

**Who are your ideal partners?**

| Attribute | Target | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Company Size | 15-50 employees | Big enough to sell, small enough to partner |
| Revenue | $2M-$15M ARR | Growth-minded, investing in capabilities |
| Customer Base | 50-300 SMBs | High volume, needs your solution |
| Technical Capability | Can deploy & manage | Reduces your support burden |
| Sales Model | Recurring revenue | Aligned incentives |

**Key Pain Points You're Solving:**

1. **Margin pressure**: They need high-margin products; your 70% gross margin supports their model
2. **Client demands**: Their customers increasingly require enterprise-grade capabilities
3. **Competitive differentiation**: You give them something competitors don't offer
4. **Support burden**: Your 24/7 support reduces their workload

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Channel Model | Their Strength | Your Response |
|------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| SentinelOne | 40% via channel | Scale, brand recognition | Better support, faster onboarding |
| CrowdStrike | Emerging | Market leadership | Dedicated partner success manager |
| Sophos | Mature (10+ years) | Partner trust | Modern platform, better margins |
| Microsoft Defender | Self-service only | Distribution | Personal relationship, customization |

## 3. Strategic Alignment & Internal Readiness

### CFO Language: The ROI Argument

**For your CFO, emphasize:**

- **Payback period**: "Breaks even in 18 months"
- **ROI**: "2.3x return over 3 years"
- **Risk mitigation**: "Phased investment minimizes exposure"
- **Cost efficiency**: "vs. $750K for 5 additional AEs"

### CEO Language: The Growth Argument

**For your CEO, emphasize:**

- **Market share**: "Competitor X has 40% revenue via channel—we're at 0%"
- **Competitive moat**: "First-mover advantage in our vertical"
- **Scalability**: "Revenue at scale without headcount linear growth"
- **Speed**: "Go to market 6 months faster than building direct"

### VP Sales Language: The Partnership Argument

**For VP Sales, emphasize:**

- **No conflict**: "Deal registration prevents channel conflict"
- **New pipeline**: "Partners sell to ICP we can't reach"
- **Coverage**: "3x pipeline coverage from channel"
- **Support**: "No displacement of direct sales"

### Cross-Functional Impact

| Department | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Sales | Some direct deals may shift to partners | Clear territory rules, deal registration |
| Marketing | Additional collateral needs | Allocate 10% to co-marketing |
| Support | Increased ticket volume | Partner training reduces escalation |
| Finance | Commission processing | Automate via CRM integration |
| Legal | Contract templates needed | Reuse existing MSA template |

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan

### Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: No Revenue in 18 Months**
- **What happens:** Executive sponsor loses patience, budget gets cut
- **Warning sign:** Partners signed but no deals after 6 months
- **Prevention:** Set milestone checkpoints every 90 days; have contingency plan

**Pitfall #2: Channel Conflict**
- **What happens:** Sales team blocks partner deals, program stalls
- **Warning sign:** Sales team not referring leads to partners
- **Prevention:** Deal registration system, clear territory rules, VP Sales involved from day 1

**Pitfall #3: Partner Churn After Year 1**
- **What happens:** Partners leave after initial enthusiasm fades
- **Warning sign:** No tier progression, declining engagement
- **Prevention:** Clear value proposition, regular QBRs, tier advancement path

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Partners not productive | Medium | High | Strong onboarding, clear expectations |
| Channel conflict | Medium | Medium | Deal registration, protected territories |
| Key partner churn | Low | High | Multi-partner strategy, no single dominant |
| Market shift | Low | High | Quarterly reviews, flexibility |
| Operational complexity | High | Medium | Phased rollout, clear processes |

### Worst Case Scenario

- Only 5 partners active by Year 2
- $500K revenue vs. $820K projected
- Program continues with reduced scope
- No additional investment required
