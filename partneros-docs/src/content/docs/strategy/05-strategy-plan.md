> **Your partner strategy isn't a document—it's a commitment. Write something you can actually execute, because your partners will read it and decide whether to invest in you.** — Dan O'Leary

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The most common strategy plan failure? Writing a strategy that's 100 pages and zero execution. If your plan takes more than 2 weeks to write, it's too complex. Partners need a 5-page strategy they can understand and act on.

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
This template creates a comprehensive partner strategy that aligns internal stakeholders, guides partner investments, and measures program success. It translates business objectives into partner-specific actions.

**Why It Works:**
A clear strategy prevents the "random acts of partnership" that plague most programs. When Sales, Marketing, and Product understand the partner strategy, everyone pulls in the same direction—and partners feel the alignment.

**Steps:**

1. **Define business alignment** — How does partner strategy support company goals? (2 hours)
2. **Map partner segments** — Who are your target partners and why? (2 hours)
3. **Design GTM strategy** — How will partners reach customers? (4 hours)
4. **Plan resources** — What do partners need to succeed? (2 hours)
5. **Set metrics** — How will you measure success? (2 hours)
6. **Socialize** — Get buy-in from Sales, Marketing, Product (ongoing)

## Strategic Alignment

### Business Context

Before writing strategy, understand where you are and where you're going. Partner strategy must support business strategy—not exist in a vacuum.

**What to document:**

- **Company 3-year objectives**: Revenue targets, market share, geographic expansion
- **Go-to-market priorities**: Direct sales, channel, product-led, etc.
- **Competitive position**: Where you win, where you lose, market dynamics
- **Resource constraints**: Budget, headcount, executive attention

**The alignment question:**
Ask: "If we had zero partners, how would we achieve our revenue target?" The answer reveals how much partners contribute—and whether your strategy is realistic.

### Partner Strategy Objectives

Translate business objectives into partner-specific outcomes:

| Business Objective | Partner Objective | Target |
|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| $10M revenue growth | Partner-sourced revenue | $3M (30%) |
| Healthcare expansion | Healthcare-specialized partners | 10 new partners |
| Customer retention | Partner-delivered NPS | 50+ NPS |

---

## Partner Segmentation

### Partner Types

Not all partners are equal. Define the types that support your GTM:

| Partner Type | Role | Revenue Model | Priority |
|-------------|------|---------------|----------|
| **Technology ISV** | Integration, co-sell | Revenue share | High |
| **System Integrator** | Implementation, services | Services margin | High |
| **Reseller** | Distribution, sales | Product margin | Medium |
| **Referral** | Lead generation | Referral fee | Medium |
| **OEM** | Bundled offering | License revenue | Selective |

### Tier Structure

Design tiers that incentivize growth:

| Tier | Revenue Target | Key Requirements | Key Benefits |
|------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Bronze** | <$100K | Registration, basic cert | Deal registration, portal access |
| **Silver** | $100K-$500K | 2+ certs, QBR | Co-marketing funds, partner manager |
| **Gold** | $500K+ | Executive sponsor, QBR | Dedicated support, joint GTM |

### Geographic Coverage

Map where partners serve your target markets:

**Coverage analysis:**

- **Target regions**: Where do you want to sell?
- **Current coverage**: Which partners serve each region?
- **Gaps**: Where do you have no coverage?
- **Priorities**: Which gaps are most urgent?

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Market Approach

Define how partners create customer demand:

**The three GTM models:**

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Lead generation** | Partners refer leads; you close | Small partners, new markets |
| **Co-sell** | Partner sells with you; shared credit | Strategic partners, complex sales |
| **Resell** | Partner sells independently | Large partners, transactional |

### Partner Roles by GTM

For each partner type, define their role:

```markdown
## Technology ISV
- **Primary role**: Integration, co-sell
- **Sales involvement**: Joint demos, customer presentations
- **Marketing involvement**: Co-marketing, events
- **Success metric**: # integrated customers

## System Integrator
- **Primary role**: Implementation, services
- **Sales involvement**: Qualified leads, RFI support
- **Marketing involvement**: Case studies, reference calls
- **Success metric**: Implementation NPS

## Reseller
- **Primary role**: Sales, renewal management
- **Sales involvement**: Deal registration, pricing
- **Marketing involvement**: Co-branded campaigns
- **Success metric**: Revenue, retention
```

### Joint Value Proposition

What do partners get from working with you?

| Value Element | Description | Evidence |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Revenue growth** | New revenue stream | Average $X partner revenue |
| **Competitive advantage** | Win more deals | X% win rate improvement |
| **Customer access** | Reach new accounts | X new logos per year |
| **Capability building** | Technical skills | Certification program |

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment

Identify and assess partnership risks:

| Risk Category | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------------|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Market** | Competitor invests heavily in channel | Medium | High | Accelerate partner investment |
| **Partner** | Top partner leaves | Low | High | Diversify partner base |
| **Operational** | Partner manager turnover | Medium | Medium | Documentation, succession |
| **Compliance** | Partner violates agreement | Low | High | Audit program, clear policies |

### Mitigation Strategies

For each high-priority risk:

```markdown
### Risk: Top Partner Leaves

**Early warning signs:**
- Reduced engagement (no calls in 30 days)
- Declining revenue (>20% drop QoQ)
- Competitor partnership announced

**Mitigation:**
- Quarterly business reviews
- Executive sponsor relationship
- Contract terms with notice period

**Contingency:**
- Identify backup partners in same segment
- Accelerate recruitment of similar partners
- Customer transition plan
```

### Contingency Planning

What happens if strategy fails?

- **Scenario A**: Partner revenue misses target by 30% → Accelerate direct sales, adjust partner targets
- **Scenario B**: Top 3 partners defect → Activate backup partners, review competitive position
- **Scenario C**: Market shifts away from channel → Pivot GTM, reduce partner investment

## What I Wish I Knew

**Strategy documents die in sharepoint:**
I used to create beautiful 50-page strategy documents. They got comments, approvals, and zero execution. Now I create 5-page strategies that fit in presentations—and update them quarterly.

**The budget conversation happens first:**
Don't write strategy without a budget. Know what you can spend before you commit to what you'll achieve. Partners will ask "how much" before they ask "why"—be ready.

**Executive sponsors need to see their name:**
In every strategy document, list who owns what. When the VP of Sales sees their name on "partner-sourced revenue target," they own it. Anonymous strategy is abandoned strategy.

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Strategy Without Budget**
- **What happens:** Ambitious targets, no resources, guaranteed failure
- **Warning sign:** Strategy document has no dollar amounts
- **Prevention:** Lock budget before finalizing strategy

**Pitfall #2: Too Many Partner Types**
- **What happens:** Diluted focus, no partner achieves scale
- **Warning sign:** More than 4 partner types in strategy
- **Prevention:** Limit to 2-3 types, add more as you scale

**Pitfall #3: Measuring Activity Instead of Outcomes**
- **What happens:** "We did 10 trainings" instead of "We grew revenue 30%"
- **Warning sign:** Metrics are inputs, not outcomes
- **Prevention:** Every metric should link to revenue or retention
