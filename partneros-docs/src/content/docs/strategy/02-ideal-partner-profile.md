> **The partner you choose in Year 1 will define your channel for years. Get this wrong, and you'll spend Years 2-4 digging yourself out.** — Dan O'Leary

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The most common mistake? Defining IPP too narrowly. You need at least 20 potential partners who meet your criteria—or your profile is a wish list, not a filter. If you can only name 5 prospects, broaden your verticals or geography.
:::

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
This template creates a structured, objective framework for identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing partner prospects. It eliminates "gut feeling" decisions and gives your entire team a common language for what "good" looks like.

**Why It Works:**
An Ideal Partner Profile (IPP) transforms subjective hiring decisions into data-driven evaluations. When Sales, Marketing, and Executive leadership share the same criteria, you stop arguing about individual partners and start building a scalable channel.

**Steps:**

1. **Gather baseline data** on your top 5 existing partners—what made them successful? (30 min)
2. **Define each attribute category** with specific, measurable criteria—not aspirations (1 hour)
3. **Create the scoring matrix** to evaluate prospects against your profile (30 min)
4. **Socialize with stakeholders**—Sales, Marketing, Product need to buy in (30 min)
5. **Treat as a living document**—review quarterly, update annually

# Ideal Partner Profile

## The Five Attributes

Every strong partner fits into five attribute categories. Skip any category and you'll hire the wrong partners. I've learned this the hard way—our first IPP missed "Commitment Signals" entirely, and we signed three partners who talked a great game but delivered nothing.

| Category | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **A. Foundational** | Industry, geography, customer overlap | Do they serve who we want to reach? |
| **B. Capability** | Technical skills, certifications, service delivery | Can they deliver what we sell? |
| **C. Go-to-Market** | Sales model, marketing, co-sell experience | Will they actually sell? |
| **D. Commitment** | Investment, executive sponsorship, resources | Will they prioritize us? |
| **E. Economics** | Deal size, margins, growth potential | Is this financially viable? |

---

## A. Foundational Attributes

These are your non-negotiables—the table stakes that determine whether a partner is even in the game.

### Industry Vertical & Segment Focus

Your vertical specialization defines everything else. A partner selling into healthcare has different needs, sales cycles, and regulations than one in manufacturing. You need alignment here or you're both wasting time.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Primary verticals served**: List the 2-3 industries where they have existing customer relationships. Be specific—"Financial Services" is useless; "Mid-market wealth management" is actionable.
- **Market leadership indicators**: Do they have reference customers in your target segment? Do analysts mention them?
- **Regulatory expertise**: For healthcare, fintech, or compliance-heavy industries, can they navigate the complexity?

**Why this matters:**
A partner with deep healthcare relationships but zero fintech experience will struggle to sell your compliance-focused product—even if they're a brilliant sales team. The reverse is equally true.

**Example:**
```
Primary Vertical: Healthcare IT
├── Sub-segment: Hospital revenue cycle management
├── Regulatory expertise: HIPAA, SOC 2, HITRUST
└── Reference customers: 3 health systems >$500M revenue

NOT A FIT: Primary vertical is retail, healthcare is "exploratory"
```

### Geographical Reach

Geography determines coverage model. A national partner with regional gaps leaves money on the table. A regional player with national ambitions may overpromise.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Territory coverage**: Where do they have active customer relationships? Map this against your target regions.
- **Market penetration depth**: In their strongest territory, what's their share of wallet? Are they #1, #2, or also-ran?
- **Expansion capacity**: Can they open new territories, or are they maxed out?

**Example:**
```
Coverage Model: National
├── Primary territories: Northeast, Southeast
├── Market depth: #2 player in Northeast healthcare IT
└── Expansion: Can open Southwest in Q3 with 2 new reps
```

### Customer Base & ICP Alignment

This is where most IPPs fail. They check for "some overlap" without quantifying it. You need hard numbers here—percentage of shared [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](../resources/glossary/) accounts, average deal size alignment, and decision-maker access.

**What to evaluate:**

- **ICP overlap**: What percentage of their active accounts match your ICP? If they're selling to 50-person startups and you're enterprise, there's no overlap—no matter how great they are.
- **Customer quality**: What's their average contract value? What's customer retention? You're tying your brand to their customers.
- **New logo potential**: Can they reach accounts you can't? This is often the strongest argument for a partner.

**Key metric:**
> Target **60%+ ICP overlap** for strategic partners. Below 40% and you're asking them to learn a new market—which takes 12-18 months and requires hand-holding you don't have time for.

## B. Capability & Solution Fit

Foundational attributes get you in the door. Capability determines whether you can actually close deals together.

### Technical Expertise & Certifications

Technical capability directly impacts implementation success and customer satisfaction. A partner who can't deliver your solution will generate churn—which lands on your doorstep.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Core competencies**: What are they technically excellent at? Integration, customization, custom development?
- **Certification depth**: How many certified professionals? What certification levels? Are they investing in more?
- **Implementation track record**: Similar deployments? References available?

**The certification conversation:**
Ask specifically: "How many people passed the certification exam on first attempt?" Low first-attempt pass rates suggest they're pushing bodies through rather than building expertise.

**Metrics to track:**

| Capability Area | Target | How to Measure |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| Certified professionals | 3+ for Silver, 5+ for Gold | Certification records |
| Implementation success rate | >90% | Post-project surveys |
| Average time to competency | <60 days | Training completion to first deployment |

### Service Delivery Capabilities

Implementation is where partnerships die. I've seen brilliant sales relationships collapse because the partner couldn't deliver. Your reputation is on the line with every deployment.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Delivery model**: Do they have dedicated implementation teams or is it "whoever's available"?
- **Managed services**: Do they offer ongoing support, or just one-time implementation?
- **Support capabilities**: What's their support SLA? 24/7? Business hours? Email only?

**Red flag warning:**
If they say "we'll figure it out" when asked about support capabilities, walk. This is the #1 cause of post-sale partnership failure.

### Unique Integrations or IP

Partners with proprietary integrations or [Intellectual Property (IP)](../resources/glossary/) create defensible value. They can't easily be replaced, and customers benefit from differentiated solutions.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Proprietary technology**: What unique tools or accelerators have they built?
- **Integration portfolio**: How many native integrations? What's their integration philosophy?
- **Solution accelerators**: Pre-built templates, industry-specific solutions, or vertical packages?

---

## C. Go-to-Market Model & Fit

Capability without go-to-market capability is worthless. They need to actually sell.

### Sales Model Alignment

Your sales model must match theirs—or one of you will be unhappy. Enterprise partners with long sales cycles won't survive on transactional products. SMB-focused partners will choke on 12-month enterprise deals.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Engagement model preference**: Co-sell, referral, resale, [OEM]( ../resources/glossary/), managed services?
- **Deal registration experience**: Do they have a process? Do they use it?
- **Average sales cycle**: 30 days and 6 months are wildly different partners.

**The deal registration question:**
Ask: "What's your current deal registration utilization?" If they don't know what deal registration is, they haven't worked in a partner program before.

### Marketing Capabilities

Marketing generates pipeline. Partners who can't generate leads will burn through your provided leads and stall. Partners with strong marketing create sustainable growth.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Demand generation**: Do they run their own campaigns? What's their lead volume?
- **Event experience**: Tradeshows, webinars, customer dinners?
- **Co-marketing willingness**: Will they co-brand? Co-fund campaigns?

**What I wish I knew:**
Early in my career, I signed a partner with excellent technical capability but zero marketing interest. They expected 100% of leads from us. When our lead flow slowed, they stopped selling entirely. Now I require demonstrated marketing investment as a prerequisite.

### Sales Methodology & Process

Process maturity predicts execution. Partners with documented sales processes convert better and scale faster.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Sales team structure**: Dedicated partner reps? Shared? Commission structure?
- **Pipeline management**: CRM usage? Forecast accuracy?
- **Qualification process**: How do they qualify opportunities? Do they use MEDDIC or similar?

---

## D. Commitment & Cultural Alignment

This is the hardest category to evaluate—and the most important. I've seen technically perfect partnerships fail because commitment wasn't real.

### Investment Signals

Words are cheap. Real commitment shows up in budget, headcount, and calendar time.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Training investment**: Budget allocated? Number of certified professionals?
- **Marketing investment**: Co-marketing fund allocation? Content development?
- **Joint business planning**: Have they scheduled quarterly reviews? Created joint account plans?

**The calendar test:**
Ask: "Can we schedule our next QBR for [specific date] in the next 2 weeks?" If they can't commit to a 1-hour meeting in 14 days, they won't commit to partnership success.

### Executive Sponsorship

Executive sponsorship determines resource allocation. Without it, your partner contact becomes a hero-or-zero—if they leave, the relationship dies.

**What to evaluate:**

- **C-level engagement**: Has their CEO or EVP met with you? Will they?
- **Strategic alignment**: Is this a priority for their leadership team?
- **Resource commitment**: What's the escalation path when things go wrong?

**The executive test:**
Ask to meet their CEO—not as a courtesy, but as a strategic partner review. Partners who deflect "the CEO doesn't do these calls" are signaling that you're a transactional vendor relationship, not a strategic partnership.

### Dedicated Resources

Talk is cheap. Headcount is real.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Practice lead**: Is there someone specifically responsible for your partnership?
- **Technical resources**: Dedicated implementation engineers? Support contacts?
- **Sales specialization**: Partner-aligned reps with quota?

**Example:**
```
Dedicated Resources (Acme Solutions):
├── Partner Account Manager: 1.0 FTE (Sarah Chen)
├── Certified Engineers: 3 (target: 5 by Q4)
├── Technical Lead: 0.5 FTE allocated
└── Marketing Coordinator: 0.25 FTE for co-marketing
```

### Past Performance with Other Vendors

Their history predicts their future. Partners who've succeeded with similar vendors will likely succeed with you.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Partnership longevity**: How long have they been with their top vendor relationships?
- **Success metrics**: What did they achieve? Can they document it?
- **Reference customers**: Willing to connect you with joint customers?

**The reference question:**
Ask for 3 reference calls: one with the vendor (to verify their claims), one with a happy customer, and one with a challenging customer. If they won't provide all three, question everything.

---

## E. Economic Viability

Partnerships must make financial sense for both sides. If the economics don't work, nothing else matters.

### Deal Economics

You need to understand their typical deal size, margin expectations, and growth trajectory.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Average deal size**: What's their typical contract? Does it align with your pricing?
- **Margin expectations**: What discount do they need? Is that sustainable?
- **Growth potential**: What's their 3-year growth plan?

**The margin conversation:**
Be direct: "What's the minimum margin you need to actively pursue deals?" If it's above your standard partner margin, there's no deal. Get this on the table early.

### Revenue Growth Trajectory

A partner's growth impacts yours. Fast-growing partners invest in capabilities. Stagnant partners become maintenance relationships.

**What to evaluate:**

- **Historical growth**: What's their 3-year revenue trend?
- **New product adoption**: How quickly do they adopt vendor new releases?
- **Customer acquisition**: Can they bring net-new logos, or only mine existing relationships?

## F. Red Flags & Disqualifiers

Not everyone qualifies. Define your hard nos upfront.

### Absolute Disqualifiers

These kill partnerships before they start:

| Red Flag | Why It's Fatal | How to Detect |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Direct competitive offering | They'll always favor their own product | Ask what else they sell |
| Poor financial health | They may not be around in 2 years | Request financial review |
| No reference customers | Can't validate claims | Demand 3 references |
| Ethical concerns | Your brand suffers by association | Background research |
| Channel conflict history | They'll fight rather than collaborate | Ask about past disputes |

### The Competitive Conflict Question

Ask directly: "What other [your category] vendors do you represent?" If they name direct competitors, proceed with extreme caution—or walk. The "we'll de-prioritize them" promise never holds.
