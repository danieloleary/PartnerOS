:::tip[Insider Tip]
The best launches are boring. If you've done the prep work, launch day should be confirmation, not discovery.

## What I Wish I Knew

The biggest mistake? Launching before training is complete. Partners who aren't ready make bad first impressions.

The second mistake? Not having a first deal ready. Nothing validates a launch like a real customer.

The third mistake? Forgetting internal comms. Your sales team needs to know partners exist.
