> **The best enablement programs get partners to first deal in 30 days. Programs that stretch to 90 days lose momentum—and partners.** — Dan O'Leary

:::tip[Insider Tip]
Partners who complete enablement within 30 days are 3x more likely to generate revenue in Year 1. Speed matters—but so does thoroughness. Balance both.
