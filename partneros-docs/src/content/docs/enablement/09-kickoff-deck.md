## What I Wish I Knew

The biggest mistake? Treating kickoff as a formality. The partners who succeed are the ones who leave this meeting excited and clear on next steps.

The second mistake? Involving too many people. Keep the first meeting to 4-6 people max—executives can join the QBR later.

The third mistake? Not customizing. Use their company name, mention their specific use cases, reference their goals. Generic kickoffs feel impersonal.
