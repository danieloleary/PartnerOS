### Do's

- **Celebrate Wins**: Start positive, acknowledge successes
- **Be Transparent**: Share challenges openly, build trust
- **Listen Actively**: QBRs should be 50/50 dialogue

- **Document Everything**: Detailed notes enable accountability
- **Follow Through**: Action items without follow-up erode trust

### Don'ts

- **Don't Surprise**: Share difficult news before the meeting
