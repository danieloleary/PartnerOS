## What I Wish I Knew

The biggest mistake? Building dashboards no one looks at. Start with 5 metrics, expand as needed.

The second mistake? Not having data ownership. Someone needs to own data quality.

The third mistake? Ignoring partner-facing dashboards. Partners want to see their performance too.
