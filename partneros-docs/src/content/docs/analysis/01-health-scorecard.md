## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
Partner churn is expensive and almost always predictable. The health scorecard

act early and allocate PAM attention to the right partners.

**Instructions:**
1. Score each dimension using the rubric below (0–20 points each)
2. Sum for total score (0–100)
3. Determine health category and recommended actions
4. Score quarterly; track trends over time
