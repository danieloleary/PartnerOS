> **Email alone doesn't work anymore. Today's partners are reached through 5-7 touchpoints across 3-4 channels before they respond. Single-channel outreach is just hoping.** — Dan O'Leary

:::tip INSIDER TIP
The "Rule of 7" applies to partner outreach: prospects need to see your message 7 times before they act. If you only send emails, you're hoping for a 1-in-7 success rate. Use multiple channels to hit 7 touchpoints faster.
:::

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
This template provides a multi-channel approach to partner outreach that combines email, LinkedIn, phone, and content to build relationships and convert prospects into partnership conversations.

**Why It Works:**
Single-channel outreach has low success rates. Multi-channel sequences that combine email + LinkedIn + phone achieve 3x higher conversion. This template sequences those touchpoints for maximum impact.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify channels** — Which channels does your prospect prefer? (15 min)
2. **Build the sequence** — Map touchpoints across 21 days (30 min)
3. **Create scripts** — Customize channel-specific messages (45 min)
4. **Set up tracking** — Measure engagement across channels (15 min)
5. **Execute and optimize** — Weekly review of what's working (ongoing)

# Multi-Channel Outreach Sequence

## The Engagement Framework

### Why Multi-Channel Works

| Channel | Strength | Best For |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Email** | Scalable, documented | Initial outreach, proposals |
| **LinkedIn** | Personal, researchable | Social proof, relationship building |
| **Phone** | Immediate, personal | Breaking through, closing |
| **Content** | Value-first approach | Building authority |
| **Events** | Deep connection | Final conversion |

### The Sequence Overview

| Week | Focus | Channels | Goal |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| Week 1 | Awareness | Email + LinkedIn | Get noticed |
| Week 2 | Interest | LinkedIn + Content | Add value |
| Week 3 | Consideration | Phone + Email | Break through |
| Week 4 | Decision | Phone + Meeting | Close the meeting |

## Week 1: Initial Contact

### Day 1: LinkedIn Connection

**Connection Request:**
```
Hi [Name], I run partner programs at [Your Company]. I've been following [Their Company]'s work in [specific area] and think there could be a natural fit. Would love to connect.
```

### Day 2: LinkedIn Follow-up (After Accept)

Thanks for connecting, [Name]! Quick note — I see you're expanding in [their focus area]. We're helping companies like [similar company] achieve [specific result]. Would you be open to a conversation if there's fit?
```

I've been trying to reach you about a partnership opportunity with [Your Company]. 

[If they seem interested]: Great — here's what I'd propose [brief summary].

## Channel-Specific Best Practices

### Email

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep under 100 words | Send attachments first touch |
| Use specific subject lines | Be generic |
| Include clear CTA | Multiple asks in one email |
| Follow up 3-4 times | Give up after 1 try |

### LinkedIn

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Personalize every message | Send mass connection requests |
| Engage with their content first | Pitch immediately |
| Build relationship before pitching | Connect and pitch same day |
| Be helpful and relevant | Be promotional |

### Phone

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Have a clear opener | Read a script verbatim |
| Lead with value | Talk about yourself first |
| Ask questions | Dominate the conversation |
| Know when to stop | Leave long voicemails |

---

## What I Wish I Knew

**LinkedIn before email:**
Starting with LinkedIn (connection + message) before email builds relationship first. Response rates are 3x higher when they've "met" you digitally before your email arrives.

**Phone at Day 10:**
The phone works best after 7-10 days of multi-touch outreach. Cold calls have <1% success. Warmed-up calls (after email + LinkedIn) have 5-10% success.

**Content is not pitching:**
Week 2 content shouldn't sell — it should help. Share articles, insights, useful information. The pitch comes later. Lead with value.

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Same Message, Different Channel**
- **What happens:** Prospects feel spammed
- **Warning sign:** "I just got this on email AND LinkedIn"
- **Prevention:** Customize message for each channel

**Pitfall #2: Too Many Channels**
- **What happens:** Prospect feels harassed
- **Warning sign:** "Please stop contacting me"
- **Prevention:** Max 4 touchpoints per week

**Pitfall #3: No Value, Just Pitch**
- **What happens:** Zero engagement
- **Warning sign:** No opens, no responses
- **Prevention:** Week 2 should be all value, no pitch
