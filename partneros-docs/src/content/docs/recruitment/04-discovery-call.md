> **The discovery call is where partnerships are won or lost. Ask the right questions, listen more than you talk, and always leave with a clear next step.** — Dan O'Leary

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The best discovery calls feel like conversations, not interrogations. Your goal is to understand their business deeply enough to propose something valuable. If you're pitching more than 30% of the time, you're doing it wrong.
:::

## How to UsePurpose:**
This script This Template

** provides a structured framework effectively for discovery calls that qualifies partners while building genuine relationships. It balances information gathering with rapport building.

**Why It Works:**
Discovery calls that are too salesy push partners away. Calls that are too passive miss critical qualification data. This script balances structured questions with conversational flow.

**Steps:**

1. **Prepare** — Research the prospect, review your qualification criteria (15 min)
2. **Structure** — Follow the call flow, adapt to conversation (30 min)
3. **Document** — Capture key insights in your notes (5 min)
4. **Follow up** — Send summary within 24 hours (15 min)

4. **Document** — Write down insights

### Key Questions

- "What's driving those priorities?"

#### Interest & Commitment

### Example Discovery Flow

```
You: "What's top of mind for [Their Company] right now?"

Them: "We're trying to break into the healthcare market."

You: "Healthcare — that's a big opportunity. What's the challenge?"

Them: "We don't have the certifications or relationships."

You: "That makes sense. How are you thinking about solving that?"

Them: "We're looking for partners who already have that access."

You: "That's exactly what we offer. Let me share how we've helped others..."
```

## Section 4: Partnership Discussion (10 minutes)

1. [Specific action item]
2. [Specific action item]
3. [Timeline]

I'll send a summary email by end of day. Does that work for your schedule?
```

I appreciate your time today. Based on our conversation, I don't think this is the right fit right now — but I'd love to stay connected as things evolve.

Is that okay with you?
```

## Handling Objections

### "It's Not the Right Time"

**Acknowledge:**
"I completely understand — timing is everything."

**Explore:**
"What would need to change for this to become a priority?"

**Address:**
"Here's what I'd propose: let's connect in 90 days when [current initiative] is complete. I'll follow up then."

### "We Don't Have Resources"

**Acknowledge:**
"That's a common challenge."

**Explore:**
"What would need to be true for resources to become available?"

**Address:**
"Many of our partners started small. Here's a minimal investment that still delivers value..."

### "We're Already Working with [Competitor]"

**Acknowledge:**
"[Competitor] is a solid company."

**Explore:**
"What's working well? What would you improve?"

**Address:**
"Most partners work with multiple vendors. Here's where we differ..."

### "I Need to Think About It"

**Acknowledge:**
"Absolutely — this is an important decision."

**Explore:**
"What specifically do you need to think about?"

## What I Wish I Knew

**Listen 70%, talk 30%:**
Early in my career, I talked too much. Now I use the "5 Whys" technique — keep asking "why" until you understand the real motivation. Partners open up when they feel heard.

**The close is in the discovery:**
If you've done good discovery, the close is obvious. If you need to hard-sell at the end, discovery failed. The close should feel like a natural next step.

**Document or forget:**
I once had a great discovery call, didn't take notes, and forgot the key insight two weeks later. Now I document in real-time or immediately after.

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Pitching Too Early**
- **What happens:** They tune out, call ends too soon
- **Warning sign:** You're talking more than 30%
- **Prevention:** Let them share first

**Pitfall #2: No Clear Next Step**
- **What happens:** Good conversation, zero follow-through
- **Warning sign:** "Let's stay in touch"
- **Prevention:** Always end with specific action + timeline

**Pitfall #3: Not Researching**
- **What happens:** Generic conversation, no rapport
- **Warning sign:** "How did you find us?"
- **Prevention:** 15 min of LinkedIn research before call
