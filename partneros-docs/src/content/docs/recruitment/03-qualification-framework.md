> **Qualifying partners isn't about saying no—it's about saying yes to the right partners. Skip qualification and you'll spend 18 months pursuing partners who were never going to work.** — Dan O'Leary

:::tip[Insider Tip]
Use the same qualification framework your Sales team uses for prospects. If Marketing and Sales both qualify to the same standard, you avoid the "Marketing said yes, Sales said no" conflict that kills partnerships before they start.
:::

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
This framework provides a consistent, objective way to evaluate potential partners. It transforms subjective "gut feelings" into data-driven decisions that stakeholders can align on.

**Why It Works:**
Without qualification criteria, partner decisions become political. This framework creates a common language: everyone scores the same way, and the numbers drive the decision.

**Steps:**

1. **Define criteria** — Customize the framework to your IPP (30 min)
2. **Gather data** — Research each prospect (1-2 hours per partner)
3. **Score objectively** — Rate each category honestly (15 min per partner)
4. **Make decision** — Apply thresholds consistently (15 min per partner)
5. **Document rationale** — Record why (5 min per partner)

## Scoring Framework

### The Scoring Scale

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **5** | Excellent | Exceeds expectations, best-in-class |
| **4** | Strong | Meets expectations, minor gaps |
| **3** | Adequate | Meets minimum, development needed |
| **2** | Weak | Significant gaps, high risk |
| **1** | Poor | Deal breaker, do not proceed |

### Qualification Thresholds

| Category | Minimum Score | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| **Strategic Fit** | 3.5 | Without fit, partnership won't last |
| **Capability** | 3.0 | Without capability, they can't deliver |
| **Value Potential** | 3.5 | Must justify investment |
| **Risk** | 3.0 | High risk = high chance of failure |
| **OVERALL** | 3.5 | Minimum to proceed |

### Deal Breakers

These automatically disqualify a partner—no matter the overall score:

- [ ] Financial instability (bankruptcy risk)
- [ ] Direct competitive offering
- [ ] Ethical concerns / poor reputation
- [ ] No reference customers
- [ ] Unwilling to get certified
- [ ] Executive says no

## What I Wish I Knew

**Score honestly:**
I used to inflate scores because I wanted the partner. Then I'd spend 6 months pursuing a 2.5 that should have been a "no." Now I score BEFORE I get excited. Emotion out, data in.

**Two people score better than one:**
Have your Sales counterpart score the same partner independently. If you both score similarly, confidence is high. If scores diverge wildly, dig deeper before deciding.

**Update quarterly:**
A partner who scored 4.0 six months ago might score 2.5 today. Markets change, companies change, people change. Re-score partners you're actively pursuing every quarter.

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Scoring After Wanting**
- **What happens:** You want the partner, so scores come out high
- **Warning sign:** Every partner scores 4.0+
- **Prevention:** Score before you get excited

**Pitfall #2: Ignoring Risk**
- **What happens:** High potential but high risk = failed partnership
- **Warning sign:** "They have great potential" appearing repeatedly
- **Prevention:** Risk score below 3.0 = automatic reconsider

**Pitfall #3: Inconsistent Standards**
- **What happens:** Different partners held to different standards
- **Warning sign:** "This one is different"
- **Prevention:** Use same scorecard for every partner
