:::tip[Insider Tip]
The best partners don't just sell to your ICP—they sell to accounts you can't reach. Map the overlap AND the complementary coverage.

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
This tracker maps your target accounts against partner coverage to identify co-sell opportunities and maximize market penetration.

**Why It Works:**
Understanding account overlap prevents channel conflict and enables smarter co-sell strategies.

**Steps:**

1. **List your ICP accounts** — Your target accounts (30 min)
2. **Map partner coverage** — Which partners serve which accounts (1 hour)
3. **Identify opportunities** — Overlap and complementary coverage (30 min)
4. **Prioritize** — Focus on high-value overlaps (ongoing)
