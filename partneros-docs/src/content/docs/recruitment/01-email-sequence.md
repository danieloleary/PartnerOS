> **The first email gets you read. The follow-up gets you replied to. Most people give up after one email—and that's why they fail at partner recruitment.** — Dan O'Leary

:::tip INSIDER TIP
The magic number is 4 emails. After 4 without response, stop. You've reached the limit of reasonable persistence. Move on to the next prospect. The partners who want to partner will respond by email 4.

# Partner Recruitment Email Sequence

## The Sequence Overview

| Email | Purpose | When | Key Goal |
|-------|---------|------|----------|
| 1. Initial Outreach | Introduce yourself and opportunity | Day 1 | Get opened and read |
| 2. Follow-up | Add value, remind them | Day 4 | Overcome "too busy" |
| 3. Value Prop | Make the case concretely | Day 7 | Demonstrate mutual value |
| 4. Final | Close the loop | Day 10 | Get a "yes" or "no" |

---

## Email 1: Initial Outreach

### Subject Line Options

Choose based on your prospect:

| Situation | Subject Line |
|-----------|-------------|
| They've won awards | "Congratulations on [Award] — here's an opportunity" |
| They're growing | "Scaling [Capability]? Let's talk" |
| Mutual connection | "[Name] suggested I reach out" |
| Generic (last resort) | "Partnership opportunity for [Company]" |

### The Template

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their company] and thought there might be a natural fit between [Their Company] and [Your Company].

What caught my attention:
- [Specific achievement #1: "You're the only partner in [Region] certified on [Product]"]
- [Specific achievement #2: "Your healthcare practice grew 40% last year"]
- [Specific achievement #3: "You've won [Specific Award]"]

We're looking to expand in [Their Market] and partners like you are exactly who we want to work with.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to see if there's mutual value?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Your Company]
[Phone]
```

### Why This Works

- **Specific observation** — Proves you did homework
- **Three bullets max** — Not overwhelming
- **Low-commitment ask** — "15-minute call" not "meeting"
- **No attachment** — Emails with attachments get deleted

---

## Email 2: Follow-up (Day 4)

### Subject Line

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| "Re: [Original Subject]" | If they opened but didn't reply |
| "Following up on [Company]" | Quick reminder |
| "Quick question about [Their Market]" | Different angle |

### The Template

```
Hi [First Name],

Just following up on my last email. I know you're busy—I almost didn't send this.

The short version: We help companies like yours [specific outcome]. I'd love to explore whether there's a fit.

Would 10 minutes work this week? Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Why This Works

- **Acknowledges their busy-ness** — "I know you're busy" = empathy
- **Very short** — Takes 10 seconds to read
- **Easy yes** — "10 minutes" feels manageable

---

## Email 3: Value Proposition (Day 7)

### Subject Line

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| "The case for [Your Company] + [Their Company]" | Specific and compelling |
| "3 ways we'd help [Their Company] grow" | Numbered list works |
| "What I'd propose..." | Direct and specific |

### The Template

```
Hi [First Name],

Third attempt — I'll stop after this one.

I wanted to share specifically what a partnership could look like:

**[Specific Outcome]:** We've helped similar partners achieve [X] in [timeframe].

**Here's how:**
- [Benefit #1]
- [Benefit #2]
- [Benefit #3]

If this isn't relevant, no worries — just let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

If it is interesting, I'm happy to send a one-pager or jump on a quick call.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Why This Works

- **Sets an end** — "I'll stop after this" removes pressure
- **Specific numbers** — "3 ways" is concrete
- **Easy opt-out** — "Just let me know" is low-pressure

---

## Email 4: Final Outreach (Day 10)

### Subject Line

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| "Last try: [Your Company]" | Clear and final |
| "Final thought — then I'm done" | Slightly self-aware humor |
| "One more thing..." | Classic but effective |

### The Template

```
Hi [First Name],

This is my last email on this topic — I promise.

I've enjoyed learning about [Their Company] from afar. [Specific observation about them].

If the timing isn't right for a partnership conversation, I completely understand. Just wanted to make sure you had the option.

If there's ever a time when [your category] makes sense, I'm here.

Best of luck with [current initiative they mentioned],
[Your Name]
```

### Why This Works

- **No pressure** — "I understand if now isn't the time"
- **Leaves door open** — Future orientation
- **Professional close** — Ends relationship positively

## Response Templates

### When They Say Yes

```
Hi [Name],

Great to hear you're interested! Here's what I'd propose:

1. **15-minute discovery call** — Understand your goals and current situation
2. **Follow-up with specifics** — Customized partnership proposal based on our conversation
3. **Decision timeline** — Most partners decide within 2 weeks of our first call

What does your week look like? I'm flexible.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### When They Say No

```
Hi [Name],

Totally understand — timing is everything.

If anything changes or the landscape shifts, I'm here. Best of luck with [their current priority].

Thanks for at least considering it.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### When They Ghost (Follow-up after no response to Email 4)

```
Hi [First Name],

Just circling back one last time. If this isn't a priority, no worries at all.

I'll remove you from my outreach sequence. No hard feelings.

If something changes, you know where to find me.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## What I Wish I Knew

**Generic outreach fails:**
Early in my career, I sent "Dear Partner, we'd love to partner with you" emails. Zero response. Once I started personalizing—specifically mentioning their company, their market, their wins—response rates went from 2% to 15%+.

**The subject line is 80% of the battle:**
I once A/B tested subject lines. Same email, different subject. "Partnership opportunity" got 20% open. "Quick question about [Their Market]" got 60% open. Subject lines matter more than email body.

**Four emails is the limit:**
I've sent 6, 7, 8 emails. The people who respond typically respond by email 4. After that, you're just annoying people. Respect the signal and move on.

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Generic Templates**
- **What happens:** "Dear Partner" gets deleted instantly
- **Warning sign:** Open rate <20%
- **Prevention:** Spend 5 minutes researching each prospect

**Pitfall #2: Too Long**
- **What happens:** Emails get skimmed or ignored
- **Warning sign:** Response rate <5%
- **Prevention:** Keep under 100 words

**Pitfall #3: No Clear Ask**
- **What happens:** Recipients don't know what to do
- **Warning sign:** "Thanks for reaching out, tell me more"
- **Prevention:** Always include specific call-to-action

**Pitfall #4: Wrong Timing**
- **What happens:** Emails get buried
- **Warning sign:** Opens but no responses
- **Prevention:** Send Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 2-4pm
