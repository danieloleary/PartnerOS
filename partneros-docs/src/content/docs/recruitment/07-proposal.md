## What I Wish I Knew

**Send proposals same week:**
I used to take 2 weeks to send proposals. Then the prospect lost interest or moved on. Now I send within 48 hours—while the conversation is fresh.

**Personalize the cover letter:**
The first page should feel written for them, not mass-produced. Reference specific things they said in the discovery call.

**Follow up on day 3:**
Don't wait for them to respond. Follow up on day 3: "Just wanted to make sure you received the proposal. Any questions?"
