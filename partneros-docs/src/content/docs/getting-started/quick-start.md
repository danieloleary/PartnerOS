## Step 2: Pick a Template (5 minutes)

Find the template that fits your need. Each template includes:

- **What it is** - Purpose and use case
- **How to use it** - Step-by-step instructions
- **What to fill in** - Brackets like `[Your Company]` where you add your info
- **Related templates** - Other templates that pair well

2. Click "Copy" on the code block
3. Paste into your document

```

**Common variables:** `{{company_name}}`, `{{contact_name}}`, `{{contact_email}}`, `{{today_date}}`

title: Template Name
description: What this template is for
---

## How to Use This Template
Step-by-step instructions...

---

# Template Name

## Section 1
[Content with placeholders like [Your Company]]

## Section 2
[More content...]
```

**Tip:** Look for text in `[brackets]` — that's where you add your specific info.
