# Partner Lifecycle

Every successful partnership follows a predictable lifecycle. PartnerOS provides templates for each phase.

## Phase 1: Strategy

**Goal:** Define *why* you need partners and *who* you're looking for.

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Partner Business Case](../strategy/01-partner-business-case.md/) | Justify the investment in partnerships |
| [Ideal Partner Profile](../strategy/02-ideal-partner-profile.md/) | Define your target partner characteristics |
| [3C/4C Evaluation](../strategy/03-evaluation-framework.md/) | Framework for assessing partner fit |
| [Competitive Differentiation](../strategy/04-competitive-differentiation.md/) | Position against competitor programs |
| [Partner Strategy Plan](../strategy/05-strategy-plan.md/) | Overall partnership strategy document |
| [Program Architecture](../strategy/06-program-architecture.md/) | Design tiers, benefits, requirements |
| [Internal Alignment](../strategy/07-internal-alignment.md/) | Get buy-in across your organization |

!!! tip "Start Here"
    If you're building a partner program from scratch, start with the **Business Case** to align stakeholders, then define your **Ideal Partner Profile**.

## Phase 2: Recruitment

**Goal:** Find, qualify, and sign the right partners.

| Template | Purpose |

| [Partnership One-Pager](../recruitment/06-one-pager.md/) | Quick overview for prospects |
| [Proposal Template](../recruitment/07-proposal.md/) | Formal partnership proposal |
| [Agreement Template](../recruitment/08-agreement.md/) | Legal partnership agreement |
| [Onboarding Checklist](../recruitment/09-onboarding.md/) | Activation checklist |
| [ICP Alignment Tracker](../recruitment/10-icp-tracker.md/) | Track customer overlap |

!!! example "Typical Recruitment Flow"

    ```

## Phase 3: Enablement

## Ongoing Operations

### Quarterly Business Reviews

Run QBRs to maintain alignment and drive growth:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Gather Metrics] --> B[Prepare QBR Doc]
    B --> C[Conduct Meeting]
    C --> D[Action Items]
    D --> E[Follow Up]
    E --> |Next Quarter| A
```

### Partner Expansion

When a partnership is thriving, use these to grow:

- Update [Partner Strategy Plan](../strategy/05-strategy-plan.md/)
- Expand [Co-Marketing](../enablement/04-co-marketing.md/)
- Deepen [Technical Integration](../enablement/05-technical-integration.md/)

### Partner Exit
