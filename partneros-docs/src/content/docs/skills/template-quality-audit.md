# Template Quality Auditor (Expert Edition)

## Purpose

This skill provides an **expert-level framework** for auditing and improving PartnerOS templates to A+ quality standard. Unlike generic templates, expert partner leaders bring strategic value—they know what moves the needle, what convinces stakeholders, and what goes wrong.

> **"The difference between a template that's a paperweight and one that drives revenue is understanding the person who'll read it—and what they actually care about."**
> — Dan O'Leary, PartnerOS

## The A+ Template Standard

An A+ template meets ALL of these criteria:

### 1. Expert Voice ✓
- **Sounds like Dan O'Leary** - confident, specific, experienced
- Uses authoritative language ("you must", "critical", "essential")
- Avoids hedging ("maybe", "possibly", "might want to consider")
- Direct actionable guidance, not suggestions

### 2. Substance Over Form ✓
- Full paragraphs explaining WHY, not just WHAT
- Context for every section
- Rationale for recommendations
- Consequences of decisions

### 3. Complete Coverage ✓
- Covers topic end-to-end (start → finish)
- Addresses edge cases
- Includes troubleshooting/common pitfalls
- Has clear next steps

### 4. No Placeholders ✓
- No empty brackets `[ ]` - real guidance only
- If placeholder needed, use specific example: "e.g., Acme Corp" not "[Company Name]"
- Every field has explanation of what goes there and why

### 5. Real Examples ✓
- Concrete, specific examples throughout
- Not generic - use realistic company names, numbers, scenarios
- Show both good AND bad examples where helpful
- Examples demonstrate the standard to achieve

### 6. Two Versions ✓

| Version | Purpose | Naming |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Template** | Fill-in-the-blank for user's use | `XX-name.md` |
| **Example** | Fully filled showing complete example | `examples/complete-examples/[category]/XX-name-example.md` |

## Expert Tactics: The Secret Sauce

### What Expert Partner Leaders Know

Expert templates include insights that only come from experience:

#### 1. "What I Wish I Knew" Insights
Include a section with hard-learned lessons:

```markdown
### What I Wish I Knew Before I Started

**The hidden cost no one talks about:**
- Partner programs take 18 months before revenue materializes
- Your first 5 partners will teach you more than any consultant

**The question that closes deals:**
- "What would it take to make this your #1 vendor in this category?"

**The mistake that kills programs:**
- Launching without clear partner success metrics
```

#### 2. Negotiation Levers
For templates involving agreements or deals:

```markdown
### Negotiation Levers

| What Partners Want | Your Leverage | Common Concession |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Higher margins | Exclusive territory | Volume bonuses |
| Faster payment | Priority leads | Quarterly vs annual |
| Co-marketing funds | Certification | Staff training |
| Protected pricing | Deal registration | Volume tiers |
```

#### 3. Internal Sell Tactics
For strategic templates (business cases, ROI):

```markdown
### How to Sell This Internally

**For the CFO:**
- Focus on: ROI, payback period, risk mitigation
- Language: "Breaks even in 18 months", "2.3x return"
- Avoid: Growth projections without cost controls

**For the CEO:**
- Focus on: Market share, competitive moat, speed to market
- Language: "First-mover advantage", "Channel vs competitors"
- Avoid: Detailed financials they can't action

**For VP Sales:**
- Focus on: Territory protection, deal registration
- Language: "No channel conflict", "Pipeline acceleration"
- Avoid: Anything that sounds like replacing direct sales
```

## Metrics That Matter

Expert templates include specific, benchmarked metrics—not vague "track progress."

### The 36 Partnership Metrics (Industry-Validated)

From partnership leader research, here are the metrics that matter:

#### Revenue Metrics
| Metric | Definition | Benchmark |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Partner-Sourced Revenue | Revenue from deals where partner is primary driver | 15-30% of total |
| Partner-Influenced Revenue | Revenue where partner contributed to sale | 25-50% of total |
| Partner Program Revenue | Total revenue from partner channel | Growing YoY |
| Revenue per Partner | Average revenue per active partner | $50K-200K |

#### Partner Health Metrics
| Metric | Definition | Benchmark |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Time to First Revenue | Days from partner signing to first deal | < 90 days |
| Time to Productivity | Days to partner's 5th deal | < 180 days |
| Partner NPS | Partner satisfaction score | 50+ |
| Partner Retention Rate | % partners renewing annually | > 80% |

#### Program Efficiency Metrics
| Metric | Definition | Benchmark |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Cost to Acquire Partner | Total acquisition cost / # partners | < $5K |
| Partner Program ROI | (Revenue - Cost) / Cost | > 3x |
| Win Rate with Partner | Close rate on co-sold deals | > 40% |
| Partner Pipeline Coverage | Partner pipeline / quota | > 3x |

### Template Metric Requirements

Every template that mentions metrics should include:

1. **Specific KPI name** (not "track progress")
2. **Industry benchmark** (so user knows target)
3. **How to measure** (formula or method)
4. **Warning signs** (what's off-track)

```markdown
### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Time to First Revenue | < 90 days | First deal date - contract signed date |
| Partner NPS | 50+ | Quarterly survey via PRM |
| Partner-Influenced Revenue | 30% of total | Marked deals in CRM + partner attribution |
```

## Stakeholder Playbooks

Expert templates speak the language of the person who'll use them.

### CFO Language
```markdown
**What they care about:**
- ROI and payback period
- Risk mitigation
- Budget predictability
- Clear success metrics

**Phrases that work:**
- "Breaks even in 18 months"
- "2.3x return on investment"
- "Fixed cost, variable return"
- "No CapEx required"
```

### CEO Language
```markdown
**What they care about:**
- Market share growth
- Competitive positioning
- Speed to market
- Scalable growth engine

**Phrases that work:**
- "First-mover advantage in channel"
- "Competitor X has 40% via channel—we're at 0%"
- "Turn fixed costs into variable"
- "Revenue at scale without headcount"
```

### VP Sales Language
```markdown
**What they care about:**
- Territory protection
- Deal registration
- No channel conflict
- Quota attainment

**Phrases that work:**
- "Deal registration prevents conflict"
- "Partners sell to ICP we can't reach"
- "3x pipeline coverage from channel"
- "No displacement of direct deals"
```

## Failure Modes: What Goes Wrong

Expert templates anticipate failure and prevent it.

### Top 5 Reasons Partner Programs Fail

| # | Failure Mode | Warning Signs | Prevention |
|---|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | No partner revenue in 18 months | Low engagement, no deals | Clear milestones, accountability |
| 2 | Channel conflict with direct sales | Sales team blocking partners | Deal registration, territories |
| 3 | Partner churn after Year 1 | No tier progression | Clear value prop, regular QBRs |
| 4 | Operational overwhelm | Missed commissions, slow onboarding | Automation, clear processes |
| 5 | Executive losing interest | No quick wins | Monthly progress reports |

### Template Failure Prevention

For each template, include:

```markdown
### Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: [Name]**
- **What happens:** [Specific failure]
- **Warning sign:** [How to detect early]
- **Prevention:** [What to do instead]

**Pitfall #2: [Name]**
- **What happens:** [Specific failure]
- **Warning sign:** [How to detect early]
- **Prevention:** [What to do instead]
```
