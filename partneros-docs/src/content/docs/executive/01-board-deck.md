## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
Board members have 5–8 minutes of attention per topic. Lead with what the program
has done for revenue. Then show the strategic picture. End with what you need.

**Instructions:**
1. Complete the KPI table with real numbers before building slides
2. Write the executive summary first — it forces clarity
3. Have finance review revenue figures before presenting
4. Trim ruthlessly — every slide should earn its place
