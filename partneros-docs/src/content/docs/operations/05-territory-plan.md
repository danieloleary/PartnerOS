Without clear territories, you get overlap (channel conflict) or gaps (missed markets). This template ensures every target market has the right partner coverage.

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The best territory plans balance coverage with partner capability. Don't just assign geography—match partner strengths to market opportunities.

## How to Use This Template

The Partner Territory Plan is created during program design and reviewed quarterly. It ensures systematic market coverage.

### Why It Works

Territory conflicts destroy partner programs. A clear plan prevents 80% of partner disputes before they happen.

## What I Wish I Knew

The biggest mistake? Assigning territories but not enforcing them. If deal registration rules aren't followed, your territory plan is meaningless.

The second mistake? Being too rigid. Markets change—review territories quarterly and adjust as needed.

The third mistake? Ignoring partner input. Your partners know their markets better than you do. Ask for their coverage recommendations.
