Partners need to know exactly what support they'll get—and what happens when issues escalate. This template defines clear tiers and expectations.

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The best support programs differentiate by partner tier. Gold partners get 24/7 coverage; Bronze partners get business hours. Clear tiers prevent disappointment.
:::

## How to Use This Template

Define your partner support model during program design. Review and update quarterly based on partner feedback.

### Why It Works

Clear support expectations prevent 80% of partner complaints. When partners know exactly what they'll get, they're happier.

## What I Wish I Knew

The third mistake? Not tracking SLA metrics. You can't improve what you don't measure.
