## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
A weekly standup is the heartbeat of an active partnership. It should be short,
structured, and action-oriented. If you leave without knowing the next step on
every active deal, the meeting failed.

**Instructions:**
- Keep it to 15–30 minutes maximum
- Partner hosts the call; PAM facilitates
- Always end with documented actions and owners
