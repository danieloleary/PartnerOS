## What I Wish I Knew

The biggest mistake? Making it all about your company. The PBR is about mutual success—spend as much time on their challenges as your goals.

The second mistake? Not preparing. If you come without data, partners lose confidence in your organization.

The third mistake? Not following up. The meeting is worthless without execution. Track every action item religiously.
