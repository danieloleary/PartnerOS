- Celebrate Milestones: Acknowledge and celebrate achievements along the roadmap to maintain motivation and engagement.
- Feedback Mechanism: Include a way for partners to provide feedback on the enablement process and resources to allow for continuous improvement. *(Refer to: Partner Strategy Plan I.5 for formal feedback mechanisms)*
