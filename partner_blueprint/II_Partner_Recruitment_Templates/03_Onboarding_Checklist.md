## Best Practices

- **Track Progress Systematically:** Use your PRM, a shared project management tool, or a collaborative document to track completion. Assign owners and due dates for each task.
- **Dynamic Review Cadence:** Review progress at key milestones (30/60/90 day health checks) with the partner and internally.
- **Tailor to Partner Type:** Customize the checklist and timeline based on partner type (e.g., ISV onboarding will have different technical steps than a referral partner).
- **Assign an Onboarding "Buddy" or Lead:** Designate an internal person responsible for guiding the partner through onboarding.
- **Celebrate Milestones:** Acknowledge and celebrate completion of key onboarding milestones (e.g., first certification, first registered deal).
- **Feedback Loop:** Continuously refine the onboarding checklist and process based on feedback from new partners and internal teams.
