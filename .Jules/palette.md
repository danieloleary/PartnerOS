## 2025-05-22 - [Monolithic UI Accessibility]
**Learning:** In projects where the frontend is served as a monolithic HTML string from a backend file (like scripts/partner_agents/web.py), accessibility features (labels, ARIA attributes) and interactive states (loading indicators) are often overlooked because they aren't part of a structured component library.
**Action:** Always audit the HTML string for missing <label> elements and ensure that asynchronous JavaScript functions (fetch calls) properly toggle disabled and textContent states on trigger buttons to prevent multiple submissions and provide feedback.
