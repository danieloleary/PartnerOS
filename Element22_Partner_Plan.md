# Element22 Partner Strategy Plan

## 1. Strategic Objectives

### Business Goals
Element22 aims to establish itself as the premier AI and data assessment provider for the NYC financial services sector, with a specific focus on leveraging Box AI capabilities. Our primary objective is to achieve $5M in partner-influenced Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) within the first 12 months of program implementation, with a specific sub-goal of generating $250K in Box-related ARR and $250K in Element22-specific ARR. We will focus on securing 10 strategic financial services customers in the NYC metropolitan area through our partner network, while simultaneously building a robust ecosystem of 5 specialized financial services partners who can deliver our solutions effectively.

As part of our Box Services Partner Program journey, we will enroll at the Member tier and work toward achieving Premier status within 12 months by meeting certification, delivery, and co-sell milestones. This progression aligns with our goal of establishing a strong presence in the NYC financial services market through Box AI capabilities.

### Partner Program Objectives
Our partner program is designed to recruit and enable 3-5 specialized financial services partners in the NYC area, with a specific focus on Box-certified partners who bring unique expertise in AI implementation and market access. We will collaborate with these partners to develop innovative joint solutions focused on Box AI and Element22's data assessment capabilities specifically tailored for financial services. The program will include comprehensive co-marketing initiatives targeting NYC financial institutions, supported by a strong partner-led implementation and support framework that ensures successful customer outcomes.

### Success Metrics
We will measure our success through a comprehensive set of metrics, including a $10M partner-sourced pipeline and $5M in partner-influenced ARR, with specific tracking of Box-related revenue ($250K) and Element22-specific revenue ($250K). Our goal is to achieve 10 joint customer wins with our partners, while maintaining a 100% partner certification completion rate. Customer satisfaction scores will be tracked and maintained at 90% or higher, ensuring the quality of our joint delivery.
