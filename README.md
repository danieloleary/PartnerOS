# Partner Ecosystem Blueprint

The **Partner Ecosystem Blueprint** is a collection of templates, playbooks, and reference material for building and scaling strategic partnerships. It distills best practices into actionable documents that can help companies design and operationalize a successful partner program.

## Directory overview

- `partner_blueprint/` – main home of the blueprint. Each file is broken out by topic (strategy, recruitment, enablement) so you can work through the templates individually. The [`SUMMARY.md`](partner_blueprint/SUMMARY.md) file lists everything in order.
- `ORIGINAL_BLUEPRINT.md` – a single, consolidated markdown document containing the entire blueprint in one file.
- `Source Materials/Blueprint_Enhanced_V2.md` – updated blueprint document with enhanced formatting and metadata.

## Using this repository

Start with the quick start guide inside `partner_blueprint/00_Quick_Start_Guide.md` or browse the table of contents in `SUMMARY.md`. All documents are Markdown files and can be edited or extended as needed.

### Frontend webapp
A React-based viewer lives in the `webapp/` directory. Run `npm install` to set up dependencies and `npm run dev` to start a local dev server via Vite. `file_list.json` is regenerated automatically by our GitHub Action or by running `python3 scripts/generate_file_list.py`.

For managing the markdown templates themselves, use `scripts/manage_templates.py`. This script can create new templates, update existing ones, apply bulk revisions across the `partner_blueprint/` directory, and even enhance a template with the OpenAI API via the `enhance` command. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the `enhance` subcommand.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you want to suggest improvements, fix typos, or add additional resources.
When adding new markdown templates, include YAML frontmatter with keys like `title`, `description`, and `section`. Commit your changes and the GitHub Action will regenerate `webapp/file_list.json`.

## The Strategic Partner Ecosystem Blueprint

This repository contains the documentation and templates for building a comprehensive and strategic partner ecosystem blueprint.

The blueprint is designed to provide a structured approach to partner strategy, recruitment, and enablement, helping organizations build and scale successful partner programs.

It includes a set of markdown templates and guides covering key aspects of the partner lifecycle.

## Web Application

A simple web application is included in the `webapp/` directory to browse the blueprint documents in a more user-friendly interface.

### Features:

*   Browse documents organized by sections.
*   Search for content across all documents.
*   View markdown documents with enhanced rendering (syntax highlighting, etc.).
*   Navigate between related documents via links.

### How to Run the Web Application:

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this repository.
3.  Run a simple HTTP server from the root directory using Python:

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

4.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/webapp/`.

The web application will load the documents from the `partner_blueprint/` and `Source Materials/` directories and display them in the browser.
