# Partner Ecosystem Blueprint

The **Partner Ecosystem Blueprint** is a collection of templates, playbooks, and reference material for building and scaling strategic partnerships. It distills best practices into actionable documents that can help companies design and operationalize a successful partner program.

## Directory overview

- `partner_blueprint/` – main home of the blueprint. Each file is broken out by topic (strategy, recruitment, enablement) so you can work through the templates individually. The [`SUMMARY.md`](partner_blueprint/SUMMARY.md) file lists everything in order.
- `ORIGINAL BLUEPRINT` – a single, consolidated markdown document containing the entire blueprint in one file.

## Using this repository

Start with the quick start guide inside `partner_blueprint/00_Quick_Start_Guide.md` or browse the table of contents in `SUMMARY.md`. All documents are Markdown files and can be edited or extended as needed.

### Frontend webapp

A simple React-based viewer lives in the `webapp/` directory. Run `python3 scripts/generate_file_list.py` to refresh `file_list.json` whenever new Markdown files are added. Then open `webapp/index.html` in a browser to navigate the blueprint with built-in search.
